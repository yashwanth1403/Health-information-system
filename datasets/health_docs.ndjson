{"id":"DOC_001","title":"Diabetes","body":"Overview:\nDiabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.\n\nAbout 830 million people worldwide have diabetes, the majority living in low-and middle-income countries. More than half of people living with diabetes are not receiving treatment. Both the number of people with diabetes and the number of people with untreated diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past decades.\n\nSymptoms:\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes include the need to urinate often, thirst, constant hunger, weight loss, vision changes and fatigue. These symptoms may occur suddenly. Symptoms for type 2 diabetes are generally similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen. For this reason, it is important to be aware of risk factors.\n\nPrevention and Treatment:\nType 1 diabetes cannot currently be prevented. Effective approaches are available to prevent type 2 diabetes and to prevent the complications and premature death that can result from all types of diabetes. These include policies and practices across whole populations and within specific settings (school, home, workplace) that contribute to good health for everyone, regardless of whether they have diabetes, such as exercising regularly, eating healthily, avoiding smoking, and controlling blood pressure and lipids.\n\nThe starting point for living well with diabetes is an early diagnosis – the longer a person lives with undiagnosed and untreated diabetes, the worse their health outcomes are likely to be. Easy access to basic diagnostics, such as blood glucose testing, should therefore be available in primary health care settings. Patients will need periodic specialist assessment or treatment for complications.\n\nA series of cost-effective interventions can improve patient outcomes, regardless of what type of diabetes they may have. These interventions include blood glucose control through a combination of diet, physical activity and, if necessary, medication; control of blood pressure and lipids to reduce cardiovascular risk and other complications; and regular screening for damage to the eyes, kidneys and feet to facilitate early treatment.\n","category":"Disease Awareness","subcategory":"Diabetes","tags":["diabetes","blood sugar","symptoms","treatment","prevention","insulin","health risks","chronic disease","lifestyle"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_002","title":"Hypertension","body":"Overview:\nHypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure. Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels. Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump.\n\nHypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases. It is a silent killer and a major cause of premature death worldwide, with an estimated 1.4 billion people having the condition. The burden of hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two thirds of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent decades.\n\nSymptoms:\nMany people with hypertension do not notice symptoms and may be unaware there is a problem. Symptoms can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears. More severe forms may exhibit fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors. If left untreated, hypertension can cause persistent chest pain (also called angina), heart attacks, heart failure, and an irregular heartbeat, which can lead to a sudden death.\n\nHypertension can also cause strokes by blocking or bursting arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the brain, as well as kidney damage, which can lead to kidney failure. High blood pressure causes damage to the heart by hardening arteries and decreasing the flow of blood and oxygen to the heart.\n\nDetecting hypertension is done with a quick and painless test of blood pressure. This can be done at home, but a health professional can help assess any risks or associated conditions.\n\nTreatment:\nReducing modifiable risk factors is the best way to prevent hypertension and associated diseases of the heart, brain, kidney and other organs. These factors include unhealthy diets (excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats, low intake of fruits and vegetables), physical inactivity, consumption of tobacco and alcohol, and being overweight or obese. Additionally, prolonged exposure to air pollution increases the risk of hypertension in adults.\n\nThere are also non-modifiable risk factors, including a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease. Avoiding dietary and behavioural risk factors is doubly important for those with unmodifiable or hereditary risk factors.\n\nHypertension can be managed by reducing and managing mental stress, regularly checking blood pressure and consulting with health professionals, treating high blood pressure and managing other medical conditions. Cessation of tobacco use and the harmful use of alcohol, as well as improvements in diet and exercise, can help reduce symptoms and risk factors from hypertension.\n","category":"Disease Awareness","tags":["hypertension","high blood pressure","heart disease","symptoms","treatment","risk factors","prevention","blood pressure testing","lifestyle changes"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/hypertension","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_003","title":"Cardiovascular Diseases","body":"Overview:\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.\n\nThe most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst environmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risk factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.\n\nCessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.\n\nIdentifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. Access to noncommunicable disease medicines and basic health technologies in all primary health care facilities is essential to ensure that those in need receive treatment and counselling.\n\nSymptoms:\nHeart attack and stroke\n\nOften, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels. A heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:\n\n- pain or discomfort in the centre of the chest; and/or\n- pain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.\n\nIn addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.\n\nThe most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body. Other symptoms include sudden onset of:\n\n- numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body;\n- confusion, difficulty speaking or understanding speech;\n- difficulty seeing with one or both eyes;\n- difficulty walking, dizziness and/or loss of balance or coordination;\n- severe headache with no known cause; and/or\n- fainting or unconsciousness.\n\nPeople experiencing these symptoms should seek medical care immediately.\n\nRheumatic heart disease\n\nSymptoms of rheumatic heart disease include: shortness of breath, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, chest pain and fainting. Symptoms of rheumatic fever (which can cause rheumatic heart disease if not treated) include: fever, pain and swelling of the joints, nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting.\n\nTreatment:\nWHO supports governments to prevent, manage and monitor CVDs by developing global strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of these diseases. These strategies include reducing risk factors, developing standards of care, enhancing health system capacity to care for patients with CVD, and monitoring disease patterns and trends to inform national and global actions.\n\nThe risk factors for CVD include behaviours such as tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and inadequate physical activity. They also include physiological factors, including high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood cholesterol and high blood sugar or glucose, which are linked to underlying social determinants and drivers such as ageing, income and urbanization.\n","category":"Disease Awareness","tags":["cardiovascular disease","CVD","heart disease","stroke","heart attack","symptoms","treatment","risk factors","blood pressure","cholesterol","prevention"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_004","title":"Cancer","body":"Overview:\nCancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. The latter process is called metastasizing and is a major cause of death from cancer. A neoplasm and malignant tumour are other common names for cancer.\n\nCancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or 1 in 6 deaths, in 2018. Lung, prostate, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer are the most common types of cancer in men, while breast, colorectal, lung, cervical and thyroid cancer are the most common among women.\n\nThe cancer burden continues to grow globally, exerting tremendous physical, emotional and financial strain on individuals, families, communities and health systems. Many health systems in low- and middle-income countries are least prepared to manage this burden, and large numbers of cancer patients globally do not have access to timely quality diagnosis and treatment. In countries where health systems are strong, survival rates of many types of cancers are improving thanks to accessible early detection, quality treatment and survivorship care.\n\nPrevention:\nBetween 30% and 50% of cancer deaths could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors and implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies. The cancer burden can also be reduced through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Prevention also offers the most cost-effective long-term strategy for the control of cancer.\n\nModifying or avoiding the following key risk factors can help prevent cancer:\n- avoid tobacco use, including cigarettes and smokeless tobacco;\n- maintain a healthy weight;\n- eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables;\n- exercise regularly;\n- limit alcohol use;\n- practice safe sex;\n- get vaccinated against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV);\n- reduce exposure to ultraviolet radiation;\n- prevent unnecessary ionizing radiation exposure (e.g. minimize occupational exposure, ensure safe and appropriate medical use of radiation in diagnosis and treatment);\n- avoid urban air pollution and indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels;\n- get regular medical care; and\n- some chronic infections are also risk factors for cancer. People in low- and middle-income countries are more likely to develop cancer through chronic infections.\n\nManagement:\nCancer is more likely to respond to effective treatment when identified early, resulting in a greater probability of surviving as well as less morbidity and less expensive treatment.\n\nThere are two distinct strategies that promote early detection:\n\n- Early diagnosis identifies symptomatic cancer cases at the earliest possible stage.\n- Screening aims to identify individuals with abnormalities suggestive of a specific cancer or pre-cancer who have not developed any symptoms and refer them promptly for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nTreatment options include surgery, cancer medicines and/or radiotherapy, administered alone or in combination. A multidisciplinary team of cancer professionals recommends the best possible treatment plan based on tumour type, cancer stage, clinical and other factors. The choice of treatment should be informed by patients’ preferences and consider the capacity of the health system.\n\nPalliative care, which focuses on improving the quality of life of patients and their families, is an essential component of cancer care. Survivorship care includes a detailed plan for monitoring cancer recurrence and detection of new cancers, assessing and managing long-term effects associated with cancer and/or its treatment, and services to ensure that cancer survivor needs are met.\n","category":"Disease Awareness","tags":["cancer","oncology","tumour","metastasis","prevention","risk factors","screening","diagnosis","radiotherapy","chemotherapy","palliative care"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/cancer","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_005","title":"Mental Health","body":"Overview:\nMental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.\n\nAt any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.\n\nMany mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered. People with mental health conditions often also experience stigma, discrimination and human rights violations.\n\nImpact:\nMental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm.\n\nIn 2019, 970 million people globally were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depression the most common.\n\nMental health conditions can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. They can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.\n\nGlobally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability. People with severe mental health conditions die 10 to 20 years earlier than the general population. And having a mental health condition increases the risk of suicide and experiencing human rights violations.\n\nThe economic consequences of mental health conditions are also enormous, with productivity losses significantly outstripping the direct costs of care.\n\nWHO Response:\nAll WHO Member States are committed to implementing the Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030, which aims to improve mental health by strengthening governance, providing community-based care, implementing promotion and prevention strategies, and strengthening information systems, evidence and research.\n\nWHO’s World mental health report: transforming mental health for all called on all countries to accelerate progress towards implementing the action plan by deepening the value given to mental health, prioritizing mental health promotion and prevention, and developing networks of community-based services.\n\nIn 2019, WHO launched the WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health (2019–2023): Universal Health Coverage for Mental Health to ensure access to quality and affordable mental health care for 100 million more people in 12 priority countries. WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) similarly aims to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders, especially in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nAs part of the QualityRights Initiative, WHO has developed a comprehensive package of training and guidance materials to build capacity in implementing a human rights and recovery approach to mental health care.\n","category":"Mental Health","tags":["mental health","mental illness","depression","anxiety","psychosocial disability","wellbeing","mental health care","prevention","treatment","WHO mental health"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/mental-health","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_006","title":"Depression","body":"Overview:\nDepressive disorder, or depression, is a common mental health condition that can happen to anyone. It is characterized by a low mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.\n\nThis is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. Depressive episodes last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. People with depression may experience disturbed sleep and changes to their appetite. They may have feelings of low self-worth, thoughts about dying and hopelessness about the future. Tiredness and poor concentration are also common.\n\nDepression results from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse events are more likely to develop depression. Problems at school and work can also result in depression.\n\nPrevention programmes have been shown to reduce depression. There are also effective psychological treatments and medications for depression. However, these are often absent or inaccessible, especially in low- and middle-income countries. It is estimated that more than 75% of people experiencing mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment.\n\nImpact:\nIn 2019, an estimated 280 million people, including 5% of all adults, experienced depression. Depression is more common among women than men. Worldwide, more than 10% of pregnant women and women who have just given birth experience depression.\n\nDepression can cause difficulties in all aspects of life, including performance at school, productivity at work, relationships with family, friends and community.\n\nResearchers estimate that 12 billion productive work days are lost every year to depression and anxiety alone, at a cost of nearly US$ 1 trillion.\n\nPeople with depression are at increased risk of suicide. Research also shows strong relationships between depression and physical health, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases.\n\nWHO Response:\nWHO works with Member States and partners to reduce the burden of mental health conditions, including depression. The Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including depression.\n\nDepression and self-harm/suicide are among the priority conditions covered by WHO’s Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). The programme aims to help countries increase services for people with depression and other disorders through care provided by non-specialist health workers in primary health care.\n\nWHO has developed effective brief psychological intervention manuals for depression that may be delivered by non-specialists to individuals and groups. Examples include Problem Management Plus, Group Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) for depression, Thinking Healthy, and the online self-help Step-by-Step programme.\n\nSelf-care and managing stress can also play an important role in promoting overall well-being and WHO has developed the self-help guide Doing What Matters in Times of Stress.\n","category":"Mental Health","tags":["depression","mental health","mood disorder","suicide risk","treatment","psychological therapy","medication","self care","mhGAP","stress management"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/depression","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_007","title":"Nutrition","body":"Overview:\nNutrition plays a vital role in health and human development. Proper nutrition contributes to improved infant, child, and maternal health, stronger immune systems, safer pregnancy and childbirth, reduced risk of noncommunicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and increased longevity.\n\nGood nutrition also improves learning outcomes in children and enhances productivity in adults, contributing to a cycle of better health, economic growth, and reduced poverty.\n\nMalnutrition exists in multiple forms and remains one of the biggest global health challenges. It includes undernutrition (wasting and stunting), micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity, and diet-related noncommunicable diseases. Low- and middle-income countries increasingly face a dual burden of undernutrition and obesity.\n\nImpact:\nGlobally, an estimated 149.2 million children under 5 years are stunted, and 45.4 million are wasted. Stunting rates are declining globally except in Africa, while over three-quarters of children suffering from severe wasting live in Asia.\n\nUndernutrition is linked to approximately 45% of deaths among children under age 5, predominantly in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nAnaemia remains a serious health concern, especially among young children and pregnant women. WHO estimates show that 40% of children under 5 and 37% of pregnant women are anaemic.\n\nAt the same time, overweight and obesity continue to rise. Around 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, and 38.9 million children under 5 are overweight.\n\nAlthough breastfeeding lowers the risk of undernutrition and excessive weight gain, only 44% of infants under 6 months are exclusively breastfed.\n\nHigh sodium intake—often exceeding the recommended 5 g/day—contributes to increased risk of hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.\n\nWHO Response:\nGuided by the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO supports global nutrition efforts by setting evidence-based guidelines, aligning policies across nations, and advocating for effective nutrition interventions.\n\nThis work is supported by several frameworks including the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition (2012), the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, and the Global strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health 2016–2030.\n\nIn 2018, the World Health Assembly endorsed the 13th General Programme of Work (GPW13), targeting improved global well-being.

{"id":"DOC_008","title":"Malaria","body":"Overview:\nMalaria is a serious and life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted through the bites of infected female *Anopheles* mosquitoes. The disease is preventable and curable. Five parasite species are known to cause malaria in humans, with *Plasmodium falciparum* and *Plasmodium vivax* posing the greatest risk.\n\nAs of 2023, almost half of the global population was at risk of malaria. While sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden, cases are also reported in the WHO Regions of South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and the Americas.\n\nIn 2023, an estimated 263 million malaria cases and approximately 597,000 malaria-related deaths occurred globally. The African Region accounted for 94% of cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 remain the most vulnerable group, representing nearly 76% of all malaria deaths in the WHO African Region.\n\nSymptoms:\nMalaria presents as an acute febrile illness. Symptoms typically appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. Early signs include fever, chills, and headache, which may be difficult to distinguish from other illnesses.\n\nIf left untreated within 24 hours, *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria can progress to severe disease and may be fatal.\n\nSevere malaria in children may result in symptoms such as severe anaemia, respiratory distress linked to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. Adults may develop multi-organ failure. In endemic regions, partial immunity may develop over time, leading to asymptomatic infections.\n\nCertain groups are at greater risk of severe disease, including infants, children under five, pregnant women, individuals with HIV/AIDS, non-immune migrants, travellers, and mobile populations. National malaria control programmes must tailor prevention measures for these high-risk populations.\n\nTreatment:\nMalaria is treatable and preventable. Early diagnosis and timely treatment reduce disease severity and prevent deaths while also limiting transmission.\n\nThe recommended first-line treatment for *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Preventive antimalarial medicines are also available.\n\nTravellers to malaria-endemic regions may prevent infection through chemoprophylaxis, which suppresses the blood stage of malaria. Travellers should seek professional medical or public health advice prior to travel.\n\nWHO recommends effective malaria vector control strategies to protect populations at risk.\n","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["malaria","mosquito-borne disease","parasite infection","Plasmodium falciparum","Plasmodium vivax","ACT therapy","vector control","preventive medicine","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/malaria","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_009","title":"Breast Cancer","body":"Breast cancer caused an estimated 670 000 deaths globally in 2022. Roughly half of all breast cancers occur in women with no specific risk factors other than sex and age. Breast cancer was the most common cancer in women in 157 countries out of 185 in 2022. Breast cancer occurs in every country in the world. Approximately 0.5–1% of breast cancers occur in men. Effective interventions for early and timely diagnosis linked to comprehensive treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care are essential to reduce the burden of breast cancer and to achieve and maintain optimal functioning and well-being.\n\n**Overview:**\nBreast cancer is a disease in which abnormal breast cells grow out of control and form tumours. If left unchecked, the tumours can spread throughout the body and become fatal. Breast cancer cells begin inside the milk ducts and/or lobules. Early breast cancer (in situ) is not life-threatening and can be detected early. Invasive breast cancer spreads to nearby tissue and can metastasize.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nIn 2022, there were an estimated 2.3 million cases and 670 000 deaths globally. The incidence varies based on human development. High HDI countries show high diagnosis but lower mortality, while low HDI countries show lower incidence but higher mortality.\n\n**Who is at risk? / Risk factors:**\nFemale gender is the strongest factor, with ~99% of breast cancers occurring in women. Other risk factors include age, obesity, harmful alcohol use, family history, radiation exposure, reproductive history, tobacco use and hormone therapy. Some cancers occur without known risk factors. Genetic mutations such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 increase breast cancer risk.\n\n**Early Detection:**\nEarly diagnosis includes awareness of symptoms and prompt medical evaluation. Screening via mammography is recommended for women aged 50–69.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms:**\nSymptoms may include:\n- lumps or thickening in the breast\n- breast size or shape changes\n- skin changes such as dimpling or redness\n- nipple changes or discharge\n- swollen lymph nodes\n\n**Management of Breast Cancer:**\nTreatment depends on stage and type. It may include:\n- surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy)\n- radiation therapy\n- medication (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted biological therapy)\nTreatment is most effective when started early and completed fully.\n\n**Global Impact:**\nMortality has decreased by ~40% in high-income countries since the 1980s. Countries that consistently apply evidence-based diagnosis and treatment see annual reductions in mortality between 2–4%.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO leads the Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) launched in 2021. Its goal is to reduce breast cancer mortality by 2.5% annually and prevent 2.5 million deaths by 2040 through health promotion, timely diagnosis and comprehensive treatment.","category":"Chronic Diseases","tags":["breast cancer","cancer","oncology","women's health","GBCI","mammography","chemotherapy","hormone therapy","BRCA mutation","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/breast-cancer","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_010","title":"Asthma","body":"Asthma is a major noncommunicable disease (NCD), affecting both children and adults, and is the most common chronic disease among children. Inflammation and narrowing of the airways cause symptoms such as cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455 000 deaths. Inhaled medications can control symptoms, and avoiding triggers reduces episodes. Most asthma-related deaths occur in low-income settings due to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.\n\n**Overview:**\nAsthma is a chronic lung disease that affects people of all ages. It results from inflammation and muscle tightening around airways, making breathing difficult. Symptoms may be mild or severe and may come and go. Asthma can be managed with proper treatment, and individuals should consult healthcare professionals if symptoms occur.\n\n**Impact:**\nAsthma is often not properly diagnosed or treated, especially in low- and middle-income countries. People with poorly managed asthma may experience sleep issues, poor concentration, missed school or work, and financial burden. Severe symptoms may require emergency care or hospitalization, and untreated conditions can lead to death.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nAsthma symptoms vary and may worsen at times, including during exercise or at night. Common symptoms include: persistent cough (especially at night), wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. Triggers include cold, weather changes, allergens, smoke, fumes, dust, perfumes, and infections. Individuals should seek medical evaluation to confirm diagnosis.\n\n**Causes:**\nAsthma risk increases due to various factors such as:\n- family history of asthma\n- allergies (eczema, rhinitis)\n- urban lifestyle\n- environmental smoke and pollution exposure\n- early childhood events affecting lungs such as low birth weight or prematurity\n- exposure to allergens (dust mites, moulds, chemicals)\n- obesity\n\n**Treatment:**\nAsthma cannot be cured, but treatments help manage symptoms. Inhalers are the primary treatment, delivering medication directly to lungs. Two main types include:\n- bronchodilators (e.g., salbutamol) to open airways\n- steroid inhalers (e.g., beclometasone) to reduce inflammation\nPeople may need daily inhaler use depending on severity. Spacers improve inhaler effectiveness, and homemade versions can work when medical devices are unavailable. Access to inhalers remains limited in many countries.\n\n**Self-care:**\nIndividuals and families need education on managing asthma, treatment options, avoiding triggers, and responding to worsening symptoms. Action plans help patients adjust medications and prevent severe attacks.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nAsthma is included in the WHO Global NCD Action Plan and the UN 2030 Sustainable Development agenda. WHO supports expanded diagnosis and treatment using the PEN primary care framework. The organization also promotes tobacco control, air pollution awareness, and global partnerships like GARD to reduce chronic respiratory illnesses. WHO initiatives such as MPOWER and training materials help reduce asthma triggers and improve care access worldwide.","category":"Chronic Diseases","tags":["asthma","respiratory disease","chronic lung disease","NCD","Noncommunicable Diseases","inhaler therapy","air pollution","WHO","GARD","tobacco exposure","public health"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_011","title":"Anaemia","body":"Anaemia is a major public health concern, mainly affecting young children, pregnant and postpartum women, and menstruating adolescent girls and women. Low- and lower-middle income countries bear the greatest burden of anaemia, particularly affecting populations living in rural settings, in poorer households and who have received no formal education. Globally, it is estimated that 40% of all children aged 6–59 months, 37% of pregnant women and 30% of women 15–49 years of age are affected by anaemia. Anaemia caused 50 million years of healthy life lost due to disability in 2019. The largest causes were dietary iron deficiency, thalassaemia and sickle cell trait, and malaria.\n\n**Overview:**\nAnaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. It mainly affects women and children. Anaemia occurs when there isn't enough haemoglobin in the body to carry oxygen to the organs and tissues. In severe cases, anaemia can cause poor cognitive and motor development in children. It can also cause problems for pregnant women and their babies. Anaemia can be caused by poor nutrition, infections, chronic diseases, heavy menstruation, pregnancy issues and family history. It is often caused by a lack of iron in the blood. Anaemia is preventable and treatable. In many low- and lower-middle income settings, the most commonly-recognized causes of anaemia are iron deficiency and malaria.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nThe population groups most vulnerable to anaemia include children under 5 years of age, particularly infants and children under 2 years of age, menstruating adolescent girls and women, and pregnant and postpartum women. Anaemia is estimated to affect half a billion women 15–49 years of age and 269 million children 6–59 months of age worldwide. In 2019, 30% (539 million) of non-pregnant women and 37% (32 million) of pregnant women aged 15–49 years were affected by anaemia. The WHO Regions of Africa and South-East Asia are most affected with an estimated 106 million women and 103 million children affected by anaemia in Africa and 244 million women and 83 million children affected in South-East Asia.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nAnaemia causes symptoms such as fatigue, reduced physical work capacity, and shortness of breath. Anaemia is an indicator of poor nutrition and other health problems. Common and non-specific symptoms of anaemia include: tiredness, dizziness or feeling light-headed, cold hands and feet, headache, and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion. Severe anaemia can cause more serious symptoms including: pale mucous membranes (in the mouth, nose etc.), pale skin and under the fingernails, rapid breathing and heart rate, dizziness when standing up, and bruising more easily.\n\n**Causes:**\nAnaemia is diagnosed based on blood haemoglobin concentrations falling below specified thresholds established based on age, sex, and physiological status. It is considered a symptom of an underlying condition(s). Anaemia may be caused by several factors: nutrient deficiencies, inadequate diet (or the inadequate absorption of nutrients), infections, inflammation, chronic diseases, gynaecological and obstetric conditions, and inherited red blood cell disorders. Iron deficiency, primarily due to inadequate dietary iron intake, is considered the most common nutritional deficiency leading to anaemia. Deficiencies in vitamin A, folate, vitamin B12 and riboflavin can also result in anaemia due to their specific roles in the synthesis of haemoglobin and/or erythrocyte production. Additional mechanisms include nutrient losses (e.g. blood loss from parasitic infections, haemorrhage associated with childbirth, or menstrual loss), impaired absorption, low iron stores at birth, and nutrient interactions affecting iron bioavailability. Infections can be another important cause of anaemia, depending on the local burden of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV and parasitic infections. Infections can impair nutrient absorption and metabolism (e.g. malaria, ascariasis) or can cause nutrient loss (e.g. schistosomiasis, hookworm infection). Many different chronic conditions can cause inflammation and lead to anaemia of inflammation or anaemia of chronic disease. HIV infection causes anaemia through a wide range of mechanisms including ineffective production or excessive destruction of red blood cells, blood loss, and side effects of the drug treatment. Consistent heavy menstrual losses, maternal blood volume expansion during pregnancy, and blood loss during and after childbirth, particularly in cases of postpartum haemorrhage, commonly lead to anaemia. Additionally, in some regions, inherited red blood cell disorders are a common cause of anaemia. These include conditions such as α- and β-thalassemia due to abnormalities of haemoglobin synthesis, sickle cell disorders due to changes in the haemoglobin structure, other haemoglobinopathies due to haemoglobin gene variants, abnormalities of red cell enzymes, or abnormalities of the red blood cell membrane.\n\n**Treatment and prevention:**\nThe treatment and prevention of anaemia depend on the underlying cause of the condition. There are many effective ways to treat and prevent anaemia. Changes in diet can help reduce anaemia in some cases, including: eating foods that are rich in iron, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin A, and other nutrients; eating a healthy diet with a variety of foods; and taking supplements if a qualified health-care provider recommends them. Other health conditions can cause anaemia. Actions include: prevent and treat malaria; prevent and treat schistosomiasis and other infections caused by soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms); get vaccinated and practice good hygiene to prevent infections; manage chronic diseases like obesity and digestive problems; wait at least 24 months between pregnancies and use birth control to prevent unintended pregnancies; prevent and treat heavy menstrual bleeding and haemorrhage before or after birth; delay umbilical cord clamping after childbirth (not earlier than 1 minute); and treat inherited red blood cell disorders like sickle-cell disease and thalassemia.\n\n**Self-care:**\nThere are several ways to help prevent and manage anaemia in daily life, including eating a healthy and diverse diet and speaking to a health-care provider early if you have symptoms of anaemia. To keep a healthy and diverse diet: eat iron-rich foods, including lean red meats, fish and poultry, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), fortified cereals and dark green leafy vegetables; eat foods rich in vitamin C (such as fruits and vegetables) which help the body absorb iron; and avoid foods that slow down iron absorption when consuming iron-rich foods, such as bran in cereals (wholewheat flour, oats), tea, coffee, cocoa and calcium. If you take calcium and iron supplements, take them at different times during the day. People with heavy menstrual bleeding should see their doctor for treatment. Doctors may recommend iron supplements or hormonal contraceptives. Some infections can cause anaemia. Wash your hands with soap and water and use clean toilets to reduce the risk of infection. Malaria can also cause anaemia. People living in places where malaria is common should follow prevention advice from local health authorities. Seek prompt treatment if you suspect you have malaria.\n\n**Global impact:**\nThe consequences of anaemia can vary. It can affect school performance (through developmental delays and behavioural disturbances such as decreased motor activity, social interaction and attention to tasks), productivity in adult life and overall quality of life in general. During pregnancy, anaemia has been associated with poor maternal and birth outcomes, including premature birth, low birth weight and maternal mortality. In addition to the health consequences, anaemia can have important financial impacts for individuals, families, communities and countries. It is estimated that for every US$ 1 invested in reducing anaemia in women, US$ 12 in economic returns could potentially be produced.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nAnaemia reduction is included as one of six World Health Assembly Global Nutrition Targets within the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition. Additionally, anaemia in women 15–49 years of age is one of the targets for the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. WHO has committed to supporting countries to reduce anaemia. At the Nutrition for Growth Summit in 2021, WHO committed to develop a comprehensive framework for action to prevent, diagnose and manage anaemia through a multisectoral approach. WHO, together with UNICEF, is also establishing an Anaemia Action Alliance, bringing partners across sectors together to support implementation of the framework at the country level.","category":"Nutritional Disorders","tags":["anaemia","anemia","iron deficiency","haemoglobin","nutritional deficiency","public health","maternal health","child health","malaria","thalassemia","sickle cell disease","vitamin deficiency","WHO","Anaemia Action Alliance","global nutrition targets"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anaemia","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_012","title":"Arthritis","body":"Arthritis affects about 1 in 5 U.S. adults. It affects the joints, tissues around the joint, and other connective tissues. Arthritis is a leading cause of work disability among adults. People with other chronic conditions—such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease—often have arthritis.\n\n**Overview:**\nArthritis is a general term for conditions that affect the joints, tissues around joints, and other connective tissues. There are more than 100 types of arthritis. The causes of some forms of arthritis are unknown. About 54 million U.S. adults have arthritis. The number of people with arthritis is expected to increase as the population grows and ages.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nSome behaviors and characteristics can increase your chances of developing arthritis. Several of these risk factors are within your control, including: smoking; having overweight or obesity; joint injuries—like from sports, falls, and accidents; and work-related activities that lead to joint injury—like bending, squatting, and other repetitive motions.\n\n**Symptoms and diagnosis:**\nSymptoms vary by arthritis type but usually include joint pain and stiffness. Health care providers can diagnose arthritis by: reviewing your health and family history; doing a physical exam; taking X-rays; and doing lab tests (as needed). Once you know the type of arthritis you have, you can work with your provider to decide on the best ways to manage and treat it.\n\n**Managing your arthritis:**\nIt is important to manage symptoms. Managing arthritis symptoms helps you: prevent or delay it from getting worse or causing disability; reduce pain; and improve your overall health and well-being. Five ways to manage arthritis and its symptoms include: learn self-management skills; be physically active; manage your weight; protect your joints; and talk to your health care provider if you have symptoms. The earlier you receive an arthritis diagnosis, the sooner you can begin treatment to lessen its effects and prevent or delay it from getting worse. Joint-friendly physical activity—like walking—can help arthritis pain.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere is no cure for arthritis, but it can be treated and managed. Treatments vary depending on arthritis type. They may include: over-the-counter medicines; physical therapy; prescription medicines; and surgery, if needed. Your provider will talk to you about these and other treatment options that are right for your arthritis type and personal needs. Rheumatologists are doctors who are trained as experts in diagnosing, treating, and caring for people with arthritis.","category":"Chronic Diseases","tags":["arthritis","joint pain","chronic disease","joint inflammation","rheumatoid arthritis","osteoarthritis","gout","work disability","physical therapy","rheumatology","joint health","CDC","chronic conditions","self-management"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/index.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_013","title":"Liver Cancer","body":"Liver cancer is a cancer that's found anywhere in the liver. The liver is a large organ at the top right side of your tummy that helps you digest your food and removes toxins. Liver cancer can sometimes start in your liver (primary) or spread from another organ (secondary). How serious liver cancer is depends on where it is in the liver, how big it is, if it has spread, if it's primary or secondary and your general health.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nLiver cancer may not have any symptoms, or they might be hard to spot. The symptoms are the same if the liver cancer starts in the liver (primary liver cancer) or spreads from another part of the body (secondary liver cancer). Symptoms of liver cancer can include: the whites of your eyes turning yellow or your skin turning yellow, which may be less obvious on brown or black skin (jaundice)—you may also have itchy skin, darker pee and paler poo than usual; loss of appetite or losing weight without trying to; feeling tired or having no energy; feeling generally unwell or having symptoms like flu; a lump in the right side of your tummy. Other symptoms can affect your digestion, such as: feeling or being sick; pain at the top right side of your tummy or in your right shoulder; symptoms of indigestion, such as feeling full very quickly when eating; a very swollen tummy that is not related to when you eat.\n\n**Causes and risk factors:**\nAnyone can get primary liver cancer. It's not always clear what causes it. You might be more likely to get it if you: are over 60—it's most common in people over 85; are a man; have certain medical conditions, such as hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, gallstones, diabetes, a parasite in the liver (liver flukes) or HIV; have a brother, sister or parent who had primary liver cancer. Secondary liver cancer is caused by cancer cells from a cancer somewhere else in the body spreading to the liver. Many liver cancers are also linked to your lifestyle.\n\n**Prevention:**\nYou cannot always prevent liver cancer. But making healthy changes can lower your chances of getting it. Recommendations include: try to lose weight if you're overweight; wear protective clothes and masks if you work in a job where you're exposed to harmful chemicals; try to cut down on alcohol—avoid drinking more than 14 units a week; try to quit smoking.\n\n**Treatment:**\nLiver cancer is often treatable, but it can be difficult to treat. The treatment you have will depend on: if the cancer started in the liver (primary) or spread from somewhere else (secondary), but treatments for primary and secondary liver cancer are similar; the size and type of liver cancer you have; where it is; if it has spread; your general health. Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, using heat to destroy the cancer (thermal ablation), targeted medicines, and radiotherapy. The specialist care team looking after you will: explain the treatments, benefits and side effects; work with you to create a treatment plan that is best for you; help you manage any side effects, including changes to your diet to help you digest your food. You'll have regular check-ups during and after any treatments. If liver cancer is found early, is small and it has not spread, you may be able to have surgery to remove it. Surgery will remove part or all of your liver. If it's all removed you will need a liver transplant to replace your liver with a donated one. Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells. For liver cancer, the chemotherapy medicine is usually given into the blood vessels of the cancer. It aims to stop the cancer growing. This is called chemoembolisation. Thermal ablation uses an electric current or microwaves to destroy the cancer. Targeted cancer medicines aim to stop the cancer from growing. Radiotherapy is where radiation is used to kill cancer cells. A type of radiotherapy called selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) is sometimes used to treat liver cancer. This is where radioactive beads are injected into your liver's blood supply to stop the cancer growing. If you have advanced liver cancer it might be very hard to treat. It may not be possible to cure the cancer. If this is the case, the aim of your treatment will be to limit the cancer and its symptoms, and help you live longer. You will be referred to a special team of doctors and nurses called the palliative care team or symptom control team. They will work with you to help manage your symptoms and make you feel more comfortable.","category":"Cancer","tags":["liver cancer","cancer","primary liver cancer","secondary liver cancer","hepatocellular carcinoma","jaundice","liver disease","hepatitis","liver cirrhosis","chemotherapy","surgery","thermal ablation","radiotherapy","targeted therapy","liver transplant","palliative care","oncology","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/liver-cancer/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_014","title":"Chronic Kidney Disease","body":"More than 1 in 7 American adults has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and as many as 9 in 10 don't know they have it. Specific blood and urine tests are needed to check for CKD. CKD can be treated, and the earlier treatment starts the better.\n\n**Overview:**\nYour kidneys, each just the size of a computer mouse, filter all the blood in your body every 30 minutes. They work hard to remove wastes, toxins, and excess fluid. They also help control blood pressure, signal the body to make red blood cells, help keep your bones healthy, and regulate blood chemicals that are essential to life. Kidneys that function properly are critical for maintaining good health. CKD is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as well as they should. Because of this, excess fluid and waste remain in the body and may cause health problems such as heart disease. Other health problems related to CKD include: anemia or low number of red blood cells; increased occurrence of infections; low calcium levels, high potassium levels, and high phosphorus levels in the blood; loss of appetite or eating less; and depression or lower quality of life. CKD has varying levels of seriousness. It usually gets worse over time, though treatment has been shown to slow progression. CKD can progress to kidney failure or end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). It also increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or kidney transplant is needed for survival. Kidney failure treated with dialysis or kidney transplant is called end-stage kidney disease. Not all people with kidney disease progress to kidney failure.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nPeople with CKD may not feel ill or notice any symptoms. The only way to find out for sure if you have CKD is through blood and urine tests. These tests measure both the creatinine level in the blood and protein in the urine.\n\n**Reducing risk:**\nTo reduce your risk of CKD: keep your blood pressure below 140/90 mm Hg (or the target your doctor sets for you); if you have diabetes, stay in your target blood sugar range as much as possible; get active—physical activity helps control blood pressure and blood sugar levels; lose weight if needed; get tested for CKD regularly if you're at risk; if you have CKD, meet with a dietician to create a kidney-healthy eating plan—the plan may need to change as you get older or if your health status changes; take medicines as instructed and ask your doctor about blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, which may protect your kidneys in addition to lowering blood pressure; if you smoke, make a plan to quit—smoking can worsen kidney disease and interfere with medication that lowers blood pressure; include a kidney doctor (nephrologist) on your health care team.\n\n**CKD by the numbers:**\nKidney diseases are a leading cause of death in the United States. About 35.5 million US adults are estimated to have CKD, and most are undiagnosed. 40% of people with severely reduced kidney function (not on dialysis) are not aware of having CKD. Every day, 360 people begin dialysis treatment for kidney failure. In the United States, diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney failure, accounting for 2 out of 3 new cases. In 2022, treating Medicare beneficiaries with CKD cost $95.7 billion, and treating people for dialysis cost $45.3 billion.","category":"Chronic Diseases","tags":["chronic kidney disease","CKD","kidney disease","kidney failure","end-stage kidney disease","ESKD","dialysis","kidney transplant","nephrology","diabetes","high blood pressure","hypertension","creatinine","proteinuria","anemia","nephrologist","ACE inhibitors","ARB","CDC","chronic conditions"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/kidney-disease/about/index.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_015","title":"Heart Attack","body":"A heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) is a serious medical emergency in which the supply of blood to the heart is suddenly blocked, usually by a blood clot. A heart attack is a medical emergency. Call 999 and ask for an ambulance if you suspect a heart attack. A lack of blood to the heart may seriously damage the heart muscle and can be life threatening.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSymptoms of a heart attack can include: chest pain—a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest; pain in other parts of the body—it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy; feeling lightheaded or dizzy; sweating; shortness of breath; feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting); an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack); coughing or wheezing. The chest pain is often severe, but some people may only experience minor pain, similar to indigestion. While the most common symptom is chest pain, symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may have other symptoms such as shortness of breath, feeling or being sick and back or jaw pain without any chest pain. Call 999 immediately if you think someone might be having a heart attack. The faster you act, the better their chances.\n\n**Treatment:**\nWhile waiting for an ambulance, it may help to chew and then swallow a tablet of aspirin (ideally 300mg), as long as the person having a heart attack is not allergic to aspirin. Aspirin helps to thin the blood and improves blood flow to the heart. In hospital, treatment for a heart attack depends on the type of heart attack, and how serious it is. The 2 main treatments are: using medicines to dissolve blood clots; and surgery to help restore blood to the heart.\n\n**Causes:**\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart attacks. CHD is a condition in which the major blood vessels (coronary arteries) that supply the heart muscle become clogged by a build-up of deposits of fatty substances, known as plaques. Before a heart attack, 1 of the plaques bursts (ruptures), causing a blood clot to develop at the site of the rupture. The clot may block the supply of blood to the heart, triggering a heart attack.\n\n**Recovery:**\nThe time it takes to recover from a heart attack will depend on the amount of damage to your heart muscle. Most people can return to work after having a heart attack. How quickly you can go back to work depends on your health, the state of your heart and the type of work you do. The recovery process aims to: reduce your risk of another heart attack through a combination of lifestyle changes (such as eating a healthy diet), and medicines (such as statins), which help to lower blood cholesterol levels; and gradually restore your physical fitness so you can resume normal activities (cardiac rehabilitation).\n\n**Complications:**\nComplications of a heart attack can be serious and possibly life threatening. These include: arrhythmias—these are abnormal heartbeats, and some types can stop the heart beating; cardiogenic shock—where the heart's muscles are severely damaged and can no longer contract properly to supply enough blood to maintain many body functions; heart rupture—where the heart's muscles, walls or valves split apart (rupture). These complications can happen quickly after a heart attack and are a leading cause of death. Some people die suddenly from a complication of a heart attack before reaching hospital or within the 1st month after a heart attack. But with treatment many people survive a heart attack. The outlook often depends on: age—serious complications are more likely as you get older; the severity of the heart attack—how much of the heart's muscle has been damaged during the attack; how long it took before a person received treatment—treatment for a heart attack should begin as soon as possible; and general health.\n\n**Prevention:**\nThere are some steps you can take to reduce your risk of having a heart attack (or having another heart attack): smokers should quit smoking; lose weight if you're overweight or obese; do regular exercise—adults should do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week, unless advised otherwise by the doctor in charge of your care; eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet, including wholegrains and at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day; and moderate your alcohol consumption.","category":"Cardiovascular Diseases","tags":["heart attack","myocardial infarction","MI","coronary heart disease","CHD","cardiac emergency","chest pain","blood clot","coronary arteries","plaque rupture","aspirin","cardiac rehabilitation","arrhythmias","cardiogenic shock","heart rupture","statins","cholesterol","cardiovascular disease","emergency","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/heart-attack/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_016","title":"Underactive Thyroid (Hypothyroidism)","body":"An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is a common condition where the thyroid gland in your neck does not make enough hormones. This can cause symptoms like tiredness and weight gain. It can be managed with treatment.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSymptoms of an underactive thyroid may be mild and may not be easy to notice. Common symptoms include: feeling extremely tired (fatigue); feeling cold more than usual; putting on weight; constipation; difficulty concentrating or thinking clearly; low mood or depression; dry skin, dry hair or hair loss; a croaky (hoarse) voice; and irregular or heavy periods if you have them. Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time. Some of the symptoms are common and can be caused by other conditions. But it's important to get them checked by a GP if you think you might have an underactive thyroid.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nIf a GP thinks you might have an underactive thyroid, they'll ask about your symptoms. They'll also ask if someone else in your family has had a thyroid condition or an autoimmune condition, or if you've recently been pregnant. The GP may examine your neck to find out if your thyroid gland is swollen. You may have blood tests to check how much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) is in your blood. The GP may also refer you to a specialist for more tests.\n\n**Treatment:**\nAn underactive thyroid is usually treated with medicine to replace the thyroid hormone that your body cannot produce. This medicine is usually levothyroxine tablets. You'll usually need to take them for the rest of your life to prevent your symptoms returning. You should be able to live a normal life. You'll have regular blood tests to check you're on the right dose of levothyroxine. Being on the wrong dose can cause side effects, such as feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, headaches or problems sleeping. If you have any side effects, talk to your GP or a pharmacist.\n\n**Causes:**\nIn the UK, the main cause of an underactive thyroid is an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto's disease. If you have Hashimoto's disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid gland meaning it cannot make enough thyroid hormone. Hashimoto's disease is most common in women, and usually starts between the ages of 30 and 50. But anyone can get an underactive thyroid. An underactive thyroid can also be caused by: having another thyroid condition, such as thyroiditis; surgery or radiotherapy around your neck or thyroid; treatment for an overactive thyroid; not getting enough iodine in your diet—this is rare in the UK; and treatment with certain medicines. You're also more likely to have an underactive thyroid if others in your family have had a thyroid condition.\n\n**Risks:**\nAn underactive thyroid is not usually serious if you're having the right treatment. If your underactive thyroid is not treated, or you're on the wrong dose of medicine, you may have an increased risk of getting: problems with your heart (including coronary heart disease and heart failure); and problems with your bones (including osteoporosis). In very rare cases, a severe underactive thyroid may lead to a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma. It's more common in older people. This is an emergency and requires treatment in hospital.\n\n**Pregnancy:**\nIf you have an underactive thyroid and are pregnant or planning to get pregnant, tell your GP. You'll need further tests and it's likely your dose of levothyroxine will need to change while you're pregnant. If it's not treated, an underactive thyroid can increase your chance of having serious complications in pregnancy, including high blood pressure (pre-eclampsia), birth defects, premature birth or miscarriage. Treatment usually helps prevent these complications, and the GP will talk to you about any risks.","category":"Endocrine Disorders","tags":["hypothyroidism","underactive thyroid","thyroid disease","thyroid gland","Hashimoto's disease","autoimmune disease","levothyroxine","TSH","thyroxine","T4","thyroid hormone","fatigue","weight gain","thyroiditis","myxoedema coma","coronary heart disease","heart failure","osteoporosis","pre-eclampsia","pregnancy","endocrinology","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/underactive-thyroid-hypothyroidism/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_017","title":"Ageing and Health","body":"All countries face major challenges to ensure that their health and social systems are ready to make the most of this demographic shift. In 2050, 80% of older people will be living in low- and middle-income countries. The pace of population ageing is much faster than in the past. In 2020, the number of people aged 60 years and older outnumbered children younger than 5 years. Between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of the world's population over 60 years will nearly double from 12% to 22%.\n\n**Overview:**\nPeople worldwide are living longer. Today most people can expect to live into their sixties and beyond. Every country in the world is experiencing growth in both the size and the proportion of older persons in the population. By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion. By 2050, the world's population of people aged 60 years and older will double (2.1 billion). The number of persons aged 80 years or older is expected to triple between 2020 and 2050 to reach 426 million. While this shift in distribution of a country's population towards older ages—known as population ageing—started in high-income countries (for example in Japan 30% of the population is already over 60 years old), it is now low- and middle-income countries that are experiencing the greatest change. By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population over 60 years will live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**Ageing explained:**\nAt the biological level, ageing results from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecular and cellular damage over time. This leads to a gradual decrease in physical and mental capacity, a growing risk of disease and ultimately death. These changes are neither linear nor consistent, and they are only loosely associated with a person's age in years. The diversity seen in older age is not random. Beyond biological changes, ageing is often associated with other life transitions such as retirement, relocation to more appropriate housing and the death of friends and partners.\n\n**Common health conditions associated with ageing:**\nCommon conditions in older age include hearing loss, cataracts and refractive errors, back and neck pain and osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, depression and dementia. As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time. Older age is also characterized by the emergence of several complex health states commonly called geriatric syndromes. They are often the consequence of multiple underlying factors and include frailty, urinary incontinence, falls, delirium and pressure ulcers.\n\n**Factors influencing healthy ageing:**\nA longer life brings with it opportunities, not only for older people and their families, but also for societies as a whole. Additional years provide the chance to pursue new activities such as further education, a new career or a long-neglected passion. Older people also contribute in many ways to their families and communities. Yet the extent of these opportunities and contributions depends heavily on one factor: health. Evidence suggests that the proportion of life in good health has remained broadly constant, implying that the additional years are in poor health. If people can experience these extra years of life in good health and if they live in a supportive environment, their ability to do the things they value will be little different from that of a younger person. If these added years are dominated by declines in physical and mental capacity, the implications for older people and for society are more negative. Although some of the variations in older people's health are genetic, most is due to people's physical and social environments—including their homes, neighbourhoods, and communities, as well as their personal characteristics—such as their sex, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. The environments that people live in as children—or even as developing fetuses—combined with their personal characteristics, have long-term effects on how they age. Physical and social environments can affect health directly or through barriers or incentives that affect opportunities, decisions and health behaviour. Maintaining healthy behaviours throughout life, particularly eating a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity and refraining from tobacco use, all contribute to reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases, improving physical and mental capacity and delaying care dependency. Supportive physical and social environments also enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity. The availability of safe and accessible public buildings and transport, and places that are easy to walk around, are examples of supportive environments. In developing a public-health response to ageing, it is important not just to consider individual and environmental approaches that ameliorate the losses associated with older age, but also those that may reinforce recovery, adaptation and psychosocial growth.\n\n**Challenges in responding to population ageing:**\nThere is no typical older person. Some 80-year-olds have physical and mental capacities similar to many 30-year-olds. Other people experience significant declines in capacities at much younger ages. A comprehensive public health response must address this wide range of older people's experiences and needs. The diversity seen in older age is not random. A large part arises from people's physical and social environments and the impact of these environments on their opportunities and health behaviour. The relationship we have with our environments is skewed by personal characteristics such as the family we were born into, our sex and our ethnicity, leading to inequalities in health. Older people are often assumed to be frail or dependent and a burden to society. Public health professionals, and society as a whole, need to address these and other ageist attitudes, which can lead to discrimination, affect the way policies are developed and the opportunities older people have to experience healthy aging. Globalization, technological developments (e.g., in transport and communication), urbanization, migration and changing gender norms are influencing the lives of older people in direct and indirect ways. A public health response must take stock of these current and projected trends and frame policies accordingly.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe United Nations (UN) General Assembly declared 2021–2030 the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing and asked WHO to lead the implementation. The UN Decade of Healthy Ageing is a global collaboration bringing together governments, civil society, international agencies, professionals, academia, the media and the private sector for 10 years of concerted, catalytic and collaborative action to foster longer and healthier lives. The Decade builds on the WHO Global Strategy and Action Plan and the United Nations Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing and supports the realization of the United Nations Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. The UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) seeks to reduce health inequities and improve the lives of older people, their families and communities through collective action in four areas: changing how we think, feel and act towards age and ageism; developing communities in ways that foster the abilities of older people; delivering person-centred integrated care and primary health services responsive to older people; and providing older people who need it with access to quality long-term care.","category":"Public Health","tags":["ageing","aging","elderly","older adults","population ageing","demographic shift","healthy ageing","geriatric syndromes","frailty","dementia","osteoarthritis","hearing loss","cataracts","diabetes","depression","urinary incontinence","falls","delirium","pressure ulcers","non-communicable diseases","ageism","UN Decade of Healthy Ageing","long-term care","public health","WHO","sustainable development"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_018","title":"Obesity and Overweight","body":"In 2022, 1 in 8 people in the world were living with obesity. Worldwide adult obesity has more than doubled since 1990, and adolescent obesity has quadrupled. In 2022, 2.5 billion adults (18 years and older) were overweight. Of these, 890 million were living with obesity. In 2022, 43% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight and 16% were living with obesity. In 2024, 35 million children under the age of 5 were overweight. Over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight in 2022, including 160 million who were living with obesity.\n\n**Overview:**\nOverweight is a condition of excessive fat deposits. Obesity is a chronic complex disease defined by excessive fat deposits that can impair health. Obesity can lead to increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, it can affect bone health and reproduction, it increases the risk of certain cancers. Obesity influences the quality of living, such as sleeping or moving. The diagnosis of overweight and obesity is made by measuring people's weight and height and by calculating the body mass index (BMI): weight (kg)/height² (m²). The body mass index is a surrogate marker of fatness and additional measurements, such as the waist circumference, can help the diagnosis of obesity. The BMI categories for defining obesity vary by age and gender in infants, children and adolescents. For adults, WHO defines overweight and obesity as follows: overweight is a BMI greater than or equal to 25; and obesity is a BMI greater than or equal to 30. For children under 5 years of age: overweight is weight-for-height greater than 2 standard deviations above WHO Child Growth Standards median; and obesity is weight-for-height greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth Standards median. For children aged between 5–19 years: overweight is BMI-for-age greater than 1 standard deviation above the WHO Growth Reference median; and obesity is greater than 2 standard deviations above the WHO Growth Reference median.\n\n**Facts about overweight and obesity:**\nIn 2022, 2.5 billion adults aged 18 years and older were overweight, including over 890 million adults who were living with obesity. This corresponds to 43% of adults aged 18 years and over (43% of men and 44% of women) who were overweight; an increase from 1990, when 25% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight. Prevalence of overweight varied by region, from 31% in the WHO South-East Asia Region and the African Region to 67% in the Region of the Americas. About 16% of adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were obese in 2022. The worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1990 and 2022. In 2024, an estimated 35 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight. Once considered a high-income country problem, overweight is on the rise in low- and middle-income countries. In Africa, the number of overweight children under 5 years has increased by nearly 12.1% since 2000. Almost half of the children under 5 years who were overweight or living with obesity in 2024 lived in Asia. Over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5–19 years were overweight in 2022. The prevalence of overweight (including obesity) among children and adolescents aged 5–19 has risen dramatically from just 8% in 1990 to 20% in 2022. The rise has occurred similarly among both boys and girls: in 2022 19% of girls and 21% of boys were overweight. While just 2% of children and adolescents aged 5–19 were obese in 1990 (31 million young people), by 2022, 8% of children and adolescents were living with obesity (160 million young people).\n\n**Causes:**\nOverweight and obesity result from an imbalance of energy intake (diet) and energy expenditure (physical activity). In most cases obesity is a multifactorial disease due to obesogenic environments, psycho-social factors and genetic variants. In a subgroup of patients, single major etiological factors can be identified (medications, diseases, immobilization, iatrogenic procedures, monogenic disease/genetic syndrome). The obesogenic environment exacerbating the likelihood of obesity in individuals, populations and in different settings is related to structural factors limiting the availability of healthy sustainable food at locally affordable prices, lack of safe and easy physical mobility into the daily life of all people, and absence of adequate legal and regulatory environment. At the same time, the lack of an effective health system response to identify excess weight gain and fat deposition in their early stages is aggravating the progression to obesity.\n\n**Common health consequences:**\nThe health risks caused by overweight and obesity are increasingly well documented and understood. In 2021, higher-than-optimal BMI caused an estimated 3.7 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, neurological disorders, chronic respiratory diseases, and digestive disorders. Being overweight in childhood and adolescence affects children's and adolescents' immediate health and is associated with greater risk and earlier onset of various NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Childhood and adolescent obesity have adverse psychosocial consequences; it affects school performance and quality of life, compounded by stigma, discrimination and bullying. Children with obesity are very likely to be adults with obesity and are also at a higher risk of developing NCDs in adulthood. The economic impacts of the obesity epidemic are also important. If nothing is done, the global costs of overweight and obesity are predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than US$ 18 trillion by 2060. Finally, the rise in obesity rates in low-and middle-income countries, including among lower socio-economic groups, is fast globalizing a problem that was once associated only with high-income countries.\n\n**Facing a double burden of malnutrition:**\nMany low- and middle-income countries face a so-called double burden of malnutrition. While these countries continue to deal with the problems of infectious diseases and undernutrition, they are also experiencing a rapid upsurge in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as obesity and overweight. It is common to find undernutrition and obesity co-existing within the same country, the same community and the same household. Children in low- and middle-income countries are more vulnerable to inadequate pre-natal, infant, and young child nutrition. At the same time, these children are exposed to high-fat, high-sugar, high-salt, energy-dense, and micronutrient-poor foods, which tend to be lower in cost but also lower in nutrient quality. These dietary patterns, in conjunction with lower levels of physical activity, result in sharp increases in childhood obesity while undernutrition issues remain unsolved.\n\n**Prevention and management:**\nOverweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable and manageable. At the individual level, people may be able to reduce their risk by adopting preventive interventions at each step of the life cycle, starting from pre-conception and continuing during the early years. These include: ensure appropriate weight gain during pregnancy; practice exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months after birth and continued breastfeeding until 24 months or beyond; support behaviours of children around healthy eating, physical activity, sedentary behaviours and sleep, regardless of current weight status; limit screen time; limit consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and energy-dense foods and promote other healthy eating behaviours; enjoy a healthy life (healthy diet, physical activity, sleep duration and quality, avoid tobacco and alcohol, emotional self-regulation); limit energy intake from total fats and sugars and increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; and engage in regular physical activity. Health practitioners need to: assess the weight and height of people accessing the health facilities; provide counselling on healthy diet and lifestyles; when a diagnosis of obesity is established, provide integrated obesity prevention and management health services including on healthy diet, physical activity and medical and surgical measures; and monitor other NCD risk factors (blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure) and assess the presence of comorbidities and disability, including mental health disorders. The dietary and physical activity patterns for individual people are largely the result of environmental and societal conditions that greatly constrain personal choice. Obesity is a societal rather than an individual responsibility, with the solutions to be found through the creation of supportive environments and communities that embed healthy diets and regular physical activity as the most accessible, available and affordable behaviours of daily life. Stopping the rise in obesity demands multisectoral actions such as food manufacturing, marketing and pricing and others that seek to address the wider determinants of health (such as poverty reduction and urban planning). Such policies and actions include: structural, fiscal and regulatory actions aimed at creating healthy food environments that make healthier food options available, accessible and desirable; and health sector responses designed and equipped to identify risk, prevent, treat and manage the disease. These actions need to build upon and be integrated into broader efforts to address NCDs and strengthen health systems through a primary health care approach. The food industry can play a significant role in promoting healthy diets by: reducing the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods; ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable to all consumers; restricting marketing of foods high in sugars, salt and fats, especially those foods aimed at children and teenagers; and ensuring the availability of healthy food choices and supporting regular physical activity practice in the workplace.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO has recognized the need to tackle the global obesity crisis in an urgent manner for many years. The World Health Assembly Global Nutrition Targets aiming to ensure no increase in childhood overweight, and the NCD target to halt the rise of diabetes and obesity by 2025, were endorsed by WHO Member States. They recognized that accelerated global action is needed to address pervasive and corrosive problem of the double burden of malnutrition. At the 75th World Health Assembly in 2022, Member States demanded and adopted new recommendations for the prevention and management of obesity and endorsed the WHO Acceleration plan to stop obesity. Since its endorsement, the Acceleration plan has shaped the political environment to generate impetus needed for sustainable change, created a platform to shape, streamline and prioritize policy, support implementation in countries and drive impact and strengthen accountability at national and global level.","category":"Nutritional Disorders","tags":["obesity","overweight","BMI","body mass index","chronic disease","type 2 diabetes","cardiovascular disease","heart disease","cancer","noncommunicable diseases","NCDs","childhood obesity","adolescent obesity","obesogenic environment","energy imbalance","malnutrition","double burden of malnutrition","undernutrition","healthy diet","physical activity","prevention","management","WHO Acceleration plan","Global Nutrition Targets","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_019","title":"Malnutrition","body":"Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting, underweight), inadequate vitamins or minerals, overweight, obesity, and resulting diet-related noncommunicable diseases. In 2022, 2.5 billion adults were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity, while 390 million were underweight. Globally in 2022, 149 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted (too short for age), 45 million were estimated to be wasted (too thin for height), and 37 million were overweight or living with obesity. Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries. The developmental, economic, social and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting, for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.\n\n**Overview:**\nMalnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person's intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions: undernutrition, which includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age); micronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess; and overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers).\n\n**Various forms of malnutrition:**\nThere are 4 broad sub-forms of undernutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Undernutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death. Low weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight. A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Low height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential. Children with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. Inadequacies in intake of vitamins and minerals often referred to as micronutrients, can also be grouped together. Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development. Iodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries. Overweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more. Among children and adolescents, BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity vary by age. Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats) and engaging in less physical activity. Diet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke, and often linked with high blood pressure), certain cancers, and diabetes. Unhealthy diets and poor nutrition are among the top risk factors for these diseases globally.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nIn 2022, approximately 390 million adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were underweight, while 2.5 billion were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity. Among children and adolescents aged 5-19 years, 390 million were overweight, including 160 million who were living with obesity. Another 190 million were living with thinness (BMI-for-age more than two standard deviations below the reference median). In 2022, an estimated 149 million children under the age of 5 years were suffering from stunting, while 37 million were living with overweight or obesity. Nearly half of deaths among children under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition. These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**Who is at risk?:**\nEvery country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges. Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition. Optimizing nutrition early in life—including the 1000 days from conception to a child's second birthday—ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits. Poverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health.\n\n**The United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition:**\nOn 1 April 2016, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly proclaimed 2016–2025 the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for addressing all forms of malnutrition. It sets a concrete timeline for implementation of the commitments made at the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) to meet a set of global nutrition targets and diet-related NCD targets by 2025, as well as relevant targets in the Agenda for Sustainable Development by 2030—in particular, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) and SDG 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages). Led by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition calls for policy action across 6 key areas: creating sustainable, resilient food systems for healthy diets; providing social protection and nutrition-related education for all; aligning health systems to nutrition needs, and providing universal coverage of essential nutrition interventions; ensuring that trade and investment policies improve nutrition; building safe and supportive environments for nutrition at all ages; and strengthening and promoting nutrition governance and accountability, everywhere.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO aims for a world free of all forms of malnutrition, where all people achieve health and wellbeing. According to the 2016–2025 nutrition strategy, WHO works with Member States and partners towards universal access to effective nutrition interventions and to healthy diets from sustainable and resilient food systems. WHO uses its convening power to help set, align and advocate for priorities and policies that move nutrition forward globally; develops evidence-informed guidance based on robust scientific and ethical frameworks; supports the adoption of guidance and implementation of effective nutrition actions; and monitors and evaluates policy and programme implementation and nutrition outcomes. This work is framed by the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition, adopted by Member States through a World Health Assembly resolution in 2012. Actions to end malnutrition are also vital for achieving the diet-related targets of the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020, the Global strategy for women's, children's, and adolescent's health 2016–2030, and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development.","category":"Nutritional Disorders","tags":["malnutrition","undernutrition","wasting","stunting","underweight","micronutrient deficiency","vitamin deficiency","mineral deficiency","iodine deficiency","vitamin A deficiency","iron deficiency","overweight","obesity","BMI","body mass index","diet-related NCDs","noncommunicable diseases","cardiovascular disease","diabetes","cancer","child malnutrition","maternal nutrition","poverty","food security","UN Decade of Action on Nutrition","SDG","sustainable development","FAO","WHO","public health","global nutrition targets"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/malnutrition","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_020","title":"Iron Deficiency Anaemia","body":"Iron deficiency anaemia is caused by lack of iron, often because of blood loss or pregnancy. It's treated with iron tablets and by eating iron-rich foods.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSymptoms of iron deficiency anaemia can include: tiredness and lack of energy; shortness of breath; noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations); paler than usual skin; and headaches. Less common symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia (that are not usually connected to pregnancy) include: hearing ringing, buzzing or hissing noises inside your head (tinnitus); food tasting strange; feeling itchy; a sore tongue; hair loss—you notice more hair coming out when brushing or washing it; wanting to eat non-food items, such as paper or ice (pica); finding it hard to swallow (dysphagia); painful open sores (ulcers) in the corners of your mouth; nail changes, such as spoon-shaped nails; and restless legs syndrome.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nTo check if you have iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history. The GP will usually do a blood test to find out if the number of red blood cells you have is normal. This is called a full blood count (FBC) test, which also looks at other types of cells in your blood. You do not need to do anything to prepare for this test. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are other types of anaemia, like vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anaemia, that the blood test will also check for. If the reason for the anaemia is not clear, the GP may do other tests to find out what might be causing your symptoms. This might include having a faecal immunochemical test (FIT) to look for blood in a sample of your poo. They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks.\n\n**Treatment:**\nOnce the reason you have iron deficiency anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) the GP will recommend treatment. If the blood test shows your red blood cell count is low, iron tablets will be recommended to replace the iron that's missing from your body. You'll need to take them for about 6 months. Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron. Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets. Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like: constipation or diarrhoea; tummy pain; heartburn; feeling sick; and darker than usual poo. Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects. Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal. Keep iron supplement tablets out of the reach of children. An overdose of iron in a young child can be fatal.\n\n**Dietary advice:**\nIf your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them. Eat more: dark-green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale; cereals and bread with extra iron in them (fortified); meat; dried fruit like apricots, prunes and raisins; and pulses (beans, peas and lentils). Eat and drink less: tea; coffee; milk and dairy; and foods with high levels of phytic acid, such as wholegrain cereals, which can stop your body absorbing iron from other foods and tablets. Large amounts of these foods and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron. You might be referred to a specialist dietitian if you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet.\n\n**Causes:**\nHeavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medicine. In pregnancy, iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet. Bleeding in the stomach and intestines is another common cause of iron deficiency anaemia. This can be caused by: taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and aspirin; stomach ulcers; inflammation of the bowel or food pipe (oesophagus); piles; and cancers of the bowel or stomach (but this is less common). Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could also lead to iron deficiency anaemia.\n\n**If iron deficiency anaemia is not treated:**\nUntreated iron deficiency anaemia: can make you more at risk of illness and infection—a lack of iron affects the immune system; may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs—such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure; and can cause a greater risk of complications before and after birth if you're pregnant.","category":"Nutritional Disorders","tags":["iron deficiency anaemia","iron deficiency","anaemia","anemia","iron tablets","iron supplements","blood loss","pregnancy","heavy periods","full blood count","FBC","red blood cells","haemoglobin","tiredness","fatigue","shortness of breath","heart palpitations","tinnitus","pica","dysphagia","restless legs syndrome","spoon-shaped nails","iron-rich foods","phytic acid","NSAIDs","stomach ulcers","tachycardia","heart failure","immune system","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_021","title":"Acne","body":"Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nAcne most commonly develops on the: face—this affects almost everyone with acne; back—this affects more than half of people with acne; and chest—this affects about 15% of people with acne.\n\n**Types of spots:**\nThere are 6 main types of spot caused by acne: blackheads—small black or yellowish bumps that develop on the skin; they're not filled with dirt, but are black because the inner lining of the hair follicle produces colour; whiteheads—have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and will not empty when squeezed; papules—small red bumps that may feel tender or sore; pustules—similar to papules, but have a white tip in the centre, caused by a build-up of pus; nodules—large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful; and cysts—the most severe type of spot caused by acne; they're large pus-filled lumps that look similar to boils and carry the greatest risk of causing permanent scarring.\n\n**Self-help techniques:**\nThese self-help techniques may be useful: do not wash affected areas of skin more than twice a day—frequent washing can irritate the skin and make symptoms worse; wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water—very hot or cold water can make acne worse; do not try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots—this can make them worse and cause permanent scarring; avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled \"comedogenic\")—use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they're less likely to block the pores in your skin; completely remove make-up before going to bed; if dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based emollient; regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem—shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne; and wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. If you develop mild acne, it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription.\n\n**When to seek medical advice:**\nIf you have mild acne, speak to a pharmacist about medicines to treat it. If these do not control your acne, or it's making you feel very unhappy, see a GP. You should see a GP if you have moderate or severe acne or you develop nodules or cysts, as they need to be treated properly to avoid scarring. Try to resist the temptation to pick or squeeze the spots, as this can lead to permanent scarring. Treatments can take several months to work, so do not expect results overnight. Once they do start to work, the results are usually good.\n\n**Causes:**\nAcne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age. Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage. Acne is known to run in families. If both your mother and father had acne, it's likely that you'll also have acne. Hormonal changes, such as those that occur during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy, can also lead to episodes of acne in women. There's no evidence that poor hygiene or sexual activity play a role in acne.\n\n**Who's affected?:**\nAcne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-20s. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 3% of adults have acne over the age of 35.","category":"Dermatological Conditions","tags":["acne","skin condition","spots","blackheads","whiteheads","papules","pustules","nodules","cysts","oily skin","sebum","P. acnes","hair follicles","pores","benzoyl peroxide","comedogenic","non-comedogenic","scarring","puberty","hormones","teenagers","adolescents","dermatology","skin care","antibiotics","topical treatment","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acne/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_022","title":"Chickenpox","body":"Chickenpox is a common infection that spreads easily and mostly affects children. It usually gets better on its own after 1 to 2 weeks without needing to see a GP, but can be serious in some people.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe main symptom of chickenpox is an itchy, spotty rash. It can be anywhere on the body. Before or after the rash appears, you might also have: a high temperature; aches and pains, and generally feel unwell; and loss of appetite. Chickenpox happens in 3 stages, but new spots can appear while others are becoming blisters or forming a scab.\n\n**Stage 1: small spots appear:**\nThe spots can: be anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth and around the genitals, which can be painful; spread or stay in a small area; be red, pink, darker or the same colour as surrounding skin, depending on your skin tone; and be harder to see on brown and black skin.\n\n**Stage 2: the spots become blisters:**\nThe spots fill with fluid and become blisters. The blisters are very itchy and may burst.\n\n**Stage 3: the blisters become scabs:**\nThe spots form a scab. Some scabs are flaky, while others leak fluid.\n\n**Self-treatment:**\nIf you have chickenpox, you'll need to stay off school, nursery or work until all the spots have formed a scab. This is usually 5 days after the spots first appeared. There are things you can do to treat chickenpox yourself at home without needing to see a GP. Do: drink plenty of fluids (try ice lollies if your child is not drinking); take paracetamol to help with any pain and discomfort; cut your child's fingernails and put socks on their hands at night to stop them scratching; use cooling creams or gels from a pharmacy; speak to a pharmacist about using antihistamine medicine to help itching; bathe in cool water and pat the skin dry (do not rub); and dress in loose clothes. Don't: do not use ibuprofen unless you're told to by a doctor, as it may cause serious skin infections; do not give aspirin to children under 16 years; and do not scratch the spots, as scratching can cause scarring. Do not go near newborn babies or anyone who's pregnant or has a weakened immune system, as chickenpox can be dangerous for them.\n\n**When to seek medical advice:**\nIf you're not sure it's chickenpox or you're concerned about yourself or your child, see a GP. Tell the receptionist you think it might be chickenpox before going in to a GP surgery. Get urgent advice from NHS 111 if: your or your child's chickenpox symptoms suddenly get worse; your child has chickenpox and is showing signs of dehydration, such as fewer wet nappies; the skin around the chickenpox blisters is hot, painful and red (redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin); you're breastfeeding and have chickenpox symptoms; you're pregnant and have not had chickenpox before (or you're not sure) and you've been near someone with chickenpox; you have a weakened immune system and have been near someone with chickenpox; or you think your newborn baby has chickenpox or has been near someone with chickenpox. Some people may be able to take medicine to prevent complications. It needs to be started within 24 hours of the spots appearing.\n\n**How chickenpox is spread:**\nYou can spread chickenpox to other people from 2 days before your spots appear until they have all formed scabs, which is usually 5 days after your spots appeared. The spots start appearing around 1 to 3 weeks after you caught chickenpox. You can catch chickenpox from: being in the same room as someone with it; touching things that have fluid from the blisters on them; and someone who has shingles if you have not had chickenpox before (but you cannot catch shingles from someone who has chickenpox).\n\n**The chickenpox vaccine:**\nYou can get the chickenpox vaccine on the NHS if there's a risk you could spread the virus to someone who has a weakened immune system. For example, a child can be vaccinated if one of their parents is having chemotherapy. You can also pay for the vaccine at some private clinics or travel clinics. It costs between £120 and £200.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["chickenpox","varicella","varicella-zoster virus","infectious disease","viral infection","rash","spots","blisters","scabs","itchy","fever","high temperature","children","contagious","spread","shingles","chickenpox vaccine","paracetamol","antihistamine","scarring","pregnancy","weakened immune system","newborn babies","dehydration","NHS 111","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chickenpox/","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_023","title":"Hair Loss","body":"Losing your hair is not usually anything to be worried about, but it can be upsetting. Treatment may help with some types of hair loss.\n\n**Causes:**\nIt's normal to lose hair. We can lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day, often without noticing. Hair loss is not usually anything to be worried about, but occasionally it can be a sign of a medical condition. Some types of hair loss are permanent, like male and female pattern baldness. This type of hair loss usually runs in the family. Other types of hair loss may be temporary. They can be caused by: an illness; stress; cancer treatment; weight loss; and iron deficiency.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if you're worried about your hair loss. The GP may be able to tell you what's causing your hair loss by looking at your hair. Tell them if your hair loss is affecting your wellbeing, and ask what treatments are available. See a GP to get an idea about what's causing your hair loss before thinking about going to a commercial hair clinic.\n\n**Treatment:**\nMost hair loss does not need treatment and is either: temporary and it'll grow back; or a normal part of getting older. Hair loss caused by a medical condition usually stops or grows back once you've recovered. There are things you can try if your hair loss is causing you distress. But not all treatments are available on the NHS, so you may have to pay. No treatment is 100% effective. Finasteride and minoxidil are the main treatments for male pattern baldness. Minoxidil can also be used to treat female pattern baldness. Women should not use finasteride. These treatments: do not work for everyone; only work for as long as they're used; and are not all available on the NHS, so can be expensive if you have to pay. Some wigs are available on the NHS, but you may have to pay unless you qualify for financial help. Synthetic wigs: last 6 to 9 months; are easier to look after than real-hair wigs; can be itchy and hot; and cost less than real-hair wigs. Real-hair wigs: last 3 to 4 years; are harder to look after than synthetic wigs; look more natural than synthetic wigs; and cost more than synthetic wigs. Other possible treatments for hair loss include: steroid injection—injections given into bald patches; steroid creams—cream applied to bald patches; immunotherapy—chemical applied to bald patches; immunotherapy tablets—tablets taken every day to prevent hair loss; light treatment—shining ultraviolet light on bald patches; permanent make-up (micropigmentation)—tattoo used to look like short hair and eyebrows; hair transplant—hair is removed from the back of the head and moved to thinning patches; scalp reduction surgery—sections of scalp with hair are stretched and stitched together; and artificial hair transplant—surgery to implant artificial hairs. Some of these treatments may not be available on the NHS.\n\n**Emotional help:**\nLosing hair can be upsetting. For many people, their hair is an important part of who they are. If your hair loss is causing you distress, your GP may be able to help you get some counselling. You may also benefit from joining a support group, or speaking to other people in the same situation on online forums.","category":"Dermatological Conditions","tags":["hair loss","alopecia","baldness","male pattern baldness","female pattern baldness","pattern hair loss","temporary hair loss","permanent hair loss","finasteride","minoxidil","wigs","synthetic wigs","real-hair wigs","steroid injection","steroid creams","immunotherapy","light treatment","micropigmentation","hair transplant","scalp reduction surgery","artificial hair transplant","stress","iron deficiency","cancer treatment","weight loss","counselling","support groups","dermatology","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/hair-loss/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_024","title":"Back Pain","body":"Back pain, particularly lower back pain, is very common. It usually improves within a few weeks but can sometimes last longer or keep coming back. There are things you can do to help ease the pain.\n\n**Causes:**\nBack pain can have many causes. It's not always obvious what causes it, and it often gets better on its own. A common cause of back pain is an injury like a pulled muscle (strain). Sometimes, medical conditions like a slipped disc, sciatica (a trapped nerve) or ankylosing spondylitis can cause back pain. Very rarely, back pain can be a sign of a serious problem such as a broken bone, cancer or an infection.\n\n**How to ease back pain yourself:**\nBack pain often improves on its own within a few weeks. There are things you can do to help speed up your recovery. Do: stay active and try to continue with your daily activities; take anti-inflammatory medicine like ibuprofen—paracetamol on its own is not recommended for back pain but it may be used with another painkiller; use an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas) wrapped in a tea towel to reduce pain and swelling; use a heat pack (or hot water bottle) wrapped in a tea towel to relieve joint stiffness or muscle spasms; and try doing some exercises and stretches for back pain. Don't: do not stay in bed for long periods of time. There are specific exercises and stretches you can do to help with back pain. But stop if your pain gets worse and see a GP for advice. Activities like walking, swimming, yoga and pilates may also help ease back pain.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if: back pain does not improve after treating it at home for a few weeks; the pain is stopping you doing your day-to-day activities; the pain is severe or getting worse over time; or you're worried about the pain or you're struggling to cope. Severe pain: always there and so bad it's hard to think or talk; you cannot sleep; and it's very hard to move, get out of bed, go to the bathroom, wash or dress. Moderate pain: always there; makes it hard to concentrate or sleep; and you can manage to get up, wash or dress. Mild pain: comes and goes; and is annoying but does not stop you doing daily activities.\n\n**Urgent advice:**\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or get help from 111 if you have back pain and: a high temperature; you've lost weight without trying to; there's a lump or swelling in your back or your back has changed shape; the pain does not improve after resting or is worse at night; the pain is made worse when sneezing, coughing or pooing; or the pain is coming from the top of your back (between your shoulders), rather than your lower back.\n\n**Immediate action required:**\nCall 999 or go to A&E if you have back pain and: pain, tingling, weakness or numbness in both legs; numbness or tingling around your genitals or buttocks; difficulty peeing; loss of bladder or bowel control (peeing or pooing yourself); chest pain; or it started after a serious accident, such as a car accident. Do not drive to A&E. Ask someone to drive you or call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Bring any medicines you take with you.\n\n**Treatments:**\nIf your back pain is severe or not getting better, a GP may prescribe painkillers or medicines to relax the muscles in your back. Other treatments may be recommended if your pain does not get better after a few weeks. These include: group exercise sessions and physiotherapy; manual therapy—where a trained therapist massages and moves the muscles, bones and joints in your back; cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to help you cope with the pain; and a procedure to seal off some of the nerves in your back so they stop sending pain signals (only for long-term lower back pain). If your back pain is caused by a medical condition like a slipped disc and other treatments have not helped, surgery may be an option. If you have back pain, you might be able to refer yourself directly to services for help with your condition without seeing a GP.","category":"Musculoskeletal Conditions","tags":["back pain","lower back pain","musculoskeletal pain","pulled muscle","strain","slipped disc","sciatica","trapped nerve","ankylosing spondylitis","ibuprofen","paracetamol","anti-inflammatory","ice pack","heat pack","exercises","stretches","walking","swimming","yoga","pilates","physiotherapy","manual therapy","CBT","cognitive behavioural therapy","surgery","pain management","NHS 111","A&E","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/back-pain/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_025","title":"Hearing Loss","body":"Hearing loss is common, particularly as you get older. See a GP if you have problems with your hearing. It could be caused by something that can be easily treated.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nIt's not always easy to tell if you're losing your hearing. Common signs include: difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in noisy places; needing to ask people to repeat themselves; listening to music or watching TV with the volume higher than other people need; difficulty hearing on the phone; finding it hard to keep up with a conversation; and feeling tired or stressed from having to concentrate while listening. Sometimes someone else might notice problems with your hearing before you do. Hearing loss can affect a child's speech development and progress at school. Hearing loss can be harder to spot in babies. There is a checklist for how a baby makes and reacts to sound on GOV.UK that can help you notice the signs.\n\n**Causes:**\nThere are lots of possible causes of hearing loss. It may be caused by something treatable or it may be permanent. Your symptoms may give you an idea what could be causing it. But do not self-diagnose, see a GP for advice. Common causes of hearing loss and related symptoms include: gradual hearing loss in both ears—aging or damage from loud noise over many years; difficulty hearing in 1 ear, earache, a high temperature, itching in and around the ear, a feeling of pressure in your ear, discharge coming out of the ear—ear infection; difficulty hearing, usually in 1 ear, itchiness, feeling like your ear is blocked—earwax build-up; sudden hearing loss after an ear infection, a very loud noise or a change in air pressure (for example, from flying)—perforated eardrum; and sudden hearing loss along with dizziness, a spinning sensation (vertigo) or ringing in your ears (tinnitus)—labyrinthitis or Ménière's disease.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if: you think your hearing is getting gradually worse; or you've had treatment for an ear infection or earwax build-up but your hearing has not come back. You can also sometimes get a free hearing test at some pharmacies and opticians.\n\n**Urgent advice:**\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: you have sudden hearing loss in 1 or both ears; your hearing has been getting worse over the last few days or weeks; or you have hearing loss along with other symptoms, such as earache or discharge coming out of the ear. It might not be anything serious, but it's best to get help as it may need to be treated quickly.\n\n**Treatments:**\nTreatment for hearing loss depends on what's causing it. Sometimes a GP may be able to treat the cause, for example: an ear infection might be treated with antibiotics; and an earwax build-up might be treated with ear drops or removed. If your hearing loss is not caused by something a GP can treat, they may refer you to a hearing specialist for further tests and treatment. If you have permanent hearing loss, a specialist will often recommend hearing aids. These will not make your hearing perfect, but they make sounds louder and clearer. Some people may need a hearing implant. These are devices that are attached to your skull or placed deep inside your ear.\n\n**Things you can do if you have hearing loss:**\nIf you have hearing loss, there are things you can do to help you communicate with others and avoid more damage to your hearing. Do: reduce background noise or move to a quieter area when talking to other people; face people when they're talking to you, so you can see their mouth, facial expressions and gestures; ask people to repeat themselves, speak more slowly and clearly or write things down if you need them to; ask a GP or specialist about tools or devices that can help, such as telephone and television amplifiers, flashing or vibrating alarms, and apps for smartphones or tablets; and wear ear protection when exposed to loud noises. Don't: do not listen to music too loudly—the volume should be just high enough for you to hear it comfortably; and do not put your fingers or any objects like cotton buds in your ears, even if you think they might be blocked.","category":"Ear, Nose and Throat Conditions","tags":["hearing loss","deafness","hearing impairment","hearing problems","aging","loud noise","ear infection","earwax build-up","perforated eardrum","labyrinthitis","Ménière's disease","vertigo","tinnitus","hearing aids","hearing implants","hearing specialist","audiologist","antibiotics","ear drops","hearing test","speech development","communication","ear protection","RNID","NHS 111","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hearing-loss/","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_026","title":"Constipation","body":"Constipation is where you have changes to how you poo, including not pooing as often or finding it hard to poo. It's common and it affects people of all ages. You can usually treat it with simple changes to your diet and lifestyle. This page is about constipation in adults. There's separate information on constipation in babies and children.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nIt's likely to be constipation if: you have not had a poo at least 3 times during the last week or you're pooing less often than usual; the poo is unusually large or small and is dry, hard or lumpy; you are straining or in pain when you have a poo; and you feel like you haven't fully emptied your bowels. You may also have a stomach ache and feel bloated or sick. If you're caring for an older person, or someone with dementia or a learning disability, constipation may be easily missed. Look out for any behaviour changes such as confusion, as it might mean they are in pain or discomfort.\n\n**Causes:**\nConstipation in adults has many possible causes. Sometimes there's no obvious reason. The most common causes include: not eating enough fibre, which is found in fruits, vegetables and cereals; not drinking enough fluids; not moving enough and spending long periods sitting or lying down; being less active and not exercising; often ignoring the urge to go to the toilet; changing your diet or daily routine; a side effect of medicine; and stress, anxiety or depression. Constipation is common during pregnancy and after giving birth. It is also more common if you are over 65 years old. Constipation can also be caused by a medical condition such as diverticular disease or bowel cancer, but this is rare.\n\n**How to treat and prevent constipation yourself:**\nMaking simple changes to your diet and lifestyle can help treat constipation. It's safe to try these simple measures when you're pregnant. You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before your symptoms improve. To make your poo softer and easier to pass: eat a healthy balanced diet and include fruits that contain sorbitol such as apples, apricots, grapes (and raisins), raspberries and strawberries; drink plenty of water and other fluids and avoid alcohol; gradually increase the fibre in your diet; and add some wheat bran, oats or linseed to your diet. Improve your toilet routine: keep to a regular time and place and give yourself plenty of time to use the toilet; do not delay if you feel the urge to poo; and to make it easier to poo, try resting your feet on a low stool while going to the toilet—if possible, raise your knees above your hips. Consider increasing your activity: a daily walk or run can help you poo more regularly. Speak to a pharmacist if diet and lifestyle changes are not helping. They can suggest a suitable laxative. These are medicines that help you poo more regularly. Most laxatives work within 3 days. They should only be used for a short time.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if you: are constipated and it's not getting better with treatment; are regularly constipated; are regularly bloated; have blood in your poo; have lost weight without trying; are constipated and feel tired all the time; are taking medicine that's causing constipation—such as opioid painkillers; notice sudden changes in the how you poo (your bowel habits); or have tummy pain. Speak to the GP before you stop taking any prescribed medicine.\n\n**Complications of long-term constipation:**\nLong-term constipation can lead to faecal impaction. This is where poo has built up in the last part of the large intestine (rectum). The main symptom is diarrhoea, which leaks through the build-up of solid poo. Faecal impaction may be treated with: stronger laxatives—prescribed by a GP; a suppository—medicine you place in your bottom; a mini enema—where fluid is passed through your bottom, into your bowel; or a healthcare professional removing some of the poo—this is not something you should do yourself.","category":"Digestive Disorders","tags":["constipation","bowel movement","digestive health","fibre","fiber","diet","lifestyle","sorbitol","wheat bran","oats","linseed","laxatives","toilet routine","faecal impaction","fecal impaction","suppository","enema","diverticular disease","bowel cancer","pregnancy","elderly","dementia","learning disability","opioid painkillers","pharmacist","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_027","title":"Cough","body":"A cough will usually clear up on its own within 3 to 4 weeks.\n\n**How to treat a cough yourself:**\nThere's usually no need to see a GP if you have a cough. You should: rest; drink plenty of fluids; and try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people if you have a high temperature or you do not feel well enough to do your normal activities. You could also try: paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat any pain; hot lemon and honey (not suitable for babies under 1 year old); and a herbal medicine called pelargonium (suitable for people aged 12 or over). But there's limited evidence to show these work. Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect to cough medicines. To make a hot lemon and honey drink: squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water; add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey; and drink while still warm (do not give hot drinks to small children). Some medicines and herbal treatments are not safe for everyone (for example, if you're pregnant). Always check the leaflet or speak to a pharmacist before taking them.\n\n**A pharmacist can help:**\nIf you have a cough, you can ask a pharmacist about: cough syrup; cough medicine (some cough medicines should not be given to children under 12 years old); and cough sweets. These will not stop your cough, but may help you cough less. Decongestants and cough medicines containing codeine will not stop your cough.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if: you've had a cough for more than 3 weeks (persistent cough); you're losing weight for no reason; or you have a weakened immune system—for example, because of chemotherapy or diabetes.\n\n**Urgent advice:**\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if: your cough is very bad or quickly gets worse—for example, you have a hacking cough or cannot stop coughing; you feel very unwell; you have chest pain; the side of your neck feels swollen and painful (swollen glands); you find it hard to breathe; or you're coughing up blood.\n\n**What happens at your appointment:**\nTo find out what's causing your cough, the GP might: listen to your chest with a stethoscope; take a sample of any mucus you might be coughing up; order an X-ray, allergy test, or a test to see how well your lungs work; or refer you to hospital to see a specialist, but this is rare. Antibiotics are not normally prescribed for coughs. A GP will only prescribe them if you need them—for example, if you have a bacterial infection or you're at risk of complications.\n\n**Causes:**\nMost coughs are caused by a cold or flu. Other causes include: smoking; heartburn (acid reflux); allergies—for example, hay fever; infections like bronchitis or COVID-19; and mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose. A cough is rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer.","category":"Respiratory Conditions","tags":["cough","persistent cough","coughing","cold","flu","viral infection","respiratory infection","bronchitis","COVID-19","smoking","heartburn","acid reflux","allergies","hay fever","paracetamol","ibuprofen","hot lemon and honey","pelargonium","cough syrup","cough medicine","cough sweets","decongestants","codeine","antibiotics","bacterial infection","lung cancer","stethoscope","X-ray","allergy test","lung function test","chemotherapy","diabetes","weakened immune system","NHS 111","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/cough/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_028","title":"High Temperature (Fever) in Children","body":"A high temperature (fever) is very common in young children. The temperature usually returns to normal within 1 to 4 days.\n\n**Checking a high temperature:**\nA normal temperature in babies and children can vary slightly from child to child. A high temperature is 38C or more. If your child has a high temperature, they might: feel hotter than usual when you touch their back or chest; feel sweaty; look or feel unwell; and have a seizure or fit, called a febrile seizure. Use a digital thermometer, which you can buy from pharmacies and supermarkets, to take your child's temperature. To take your child's temperature: place the thermometer inside the top of the armpit; gently close the arm over the thermometer and keep it pressed to the side of the body; leave the thermometer in place for as long as it says in the instruction leaflet—some digital thermometers beep when they're ready; and remove the thermometer—the display will show your child's temperature. If your child has just had a bath or been wrapped in a blanket, their temperature may be higher for a short time. Wait a few minutes then try again.\n\n**What to do if your child has a high temperature:**\nIf your child or baby has a high temperature, you can usually look after them at home. The temperature should go down over 1 to 4 days. Do: give them plenty of fluids—if your baby is breastfed, continue to breastfeed as normal; look out for signs of dehydration; give them food if they want it; check on your child regularly, including during the night; keep them at home; give them either paracetamol or ibuprofen if they're distressed or uncomfortable—check the packaging or leaflet to make sure the medicine is suitable for your child, or speak to a pharmacist or GP if you're not sure; and get medical advice if you're worried about your child, or if the paracetamol or ibuprofen is not helping. Don't: do not undress your child or sponge them down to cool them—a high temperature is a natural and healthy response to infection; do not cover them up in too many clothes or bedclothes; do not give aspirin to children under 16 years of age; do not alternate ibuprofen and paracetamol, unless a health professional such as a doctor or nurse tells you to; do not give paracetamol to a child under 2 months; do not give ibuprofen to a child who is under 3 months, weighs under 5kg, has chickenpox, or is dehydrated; and do not give ibuprofen to children with asthma unless it's been recommended by a doctor.\n\n**Urgent advice:**\nCall 111 or your GP surgery now if your child: is under 3 months old and has a temperature of 38C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature; is 3 to 6 months old and has a temperature of 39C or higher, or you think they have a high temperature; has other signs of illness, such as a rash, as well as a high temperature; has a high temperature that's lasted for 5 days or more; does not want to eat, or is not their usual self and you're worried; or is dehydrated—such as nappies that are not very wet, sunken eyes, and no tears when they're crying.\n\n**Immediate action required:**\nCall 999 if your child: has a stiff neck; has a rash that does not fade when you press a glass against it; is bothered by light; has a fit (febrile seizure) for the first time (they cannot stop shaking); has unusually cold hands and feet; has changes to their skin colour such as blue, grey, paler than usual or blotchy skin (this may be harder to see on brown or black skin), or blue, grey or paler than usual lips or tongue; is drowsy and hard to wake; is extremely agitated (does not stop crying) or is confused; has difficulty breathing (you may notice grunting noises or their stomach sucking under their ribcage), breathlessness or breathing very fast; or is not responding like they normally do, or is not interested in feeding or normal activities.\n\n**Causes:**\nA high temperature is the body's natural response to fighting infections like coughs and colds. Many things can cause a high temperature in children, from common childhood illnesses like chickenpox and tonsillitis, to vaccinations.","category":"Pediatric Conditions","tags":["fever","high temperature","children","babies","pediatric","febrile seizure","digital thermometer","paracetamol","ibuprofen","aspirin","dehydration","breastfeeding","chickenpox","asthma","infection","coughs","colds","tonsillitis","vaccinations","stiff neck","rash","meningitis","sepsis","NHS 111","999","emergency","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/fever-in-children/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_029","title":"What to do if Someone has a Seizure (Fit)","body":"If you see someone having a seizure or fit, there are some simple things you can do to help. It might be scary to witness, but do not panic.\n\n**What to do during a seizure:**\nIf you're with someone having a seizure: only move them if they're in danger, such as near a busy road or hot cooker; cushion their head if they're on the ground; loosen any tight clothing around their neck, such as a collar or tie, to aid breathing; turn them on to their side after their convulsions stop; stay with them and talk to them calmly until they recover; and note the time the seizure starts and finishes. If the person is in a wheelchair, put the brakes on and leave any seatbelt or harness on. Support them gently and cushion their head, but do not try to move them. Do not put anything in their mouth, including your fingers. They should not have any food or drink until they have fully recovered.\n\n**When to call an ambulance:**\nCall 999 and ask for an ambulance if: it's the first time someone has had a seizure; the seizure lasts longer than is usual for them; the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, if you do not know how long their seizures usually last; the person does not regain full consciousness, or has several seizures without regaining consciousness; the person is seriously injured during the seizure; or the person has difficulty breathing after the seizure. People with epilepsy do not always need an ambulance or to go to hospital every time they have a seizure. They usually have a care plan agreed with doctors and their family or carers that says what to do when they have a seizure, such as giving emergency medicine. If you know what to do and have been trained then you can follow their care plan. Some people with epilepsy wear a special bracelet or carry a card to let medical professionals and anyone witnessing a seizure know they have epilepsy.\n\n**Make a note of useful information:**\nIf you see someone having a seizure, you may notice things that could be useful for the person or their doctor to know: what were they doing before the seizure?; did the person mention any unusual sensations, such as an odd smell or taste?; did you notice any mood change, such as excitement, anxiety or anger?; what brought your attention to the seizure? Was it a noise, such as the person falling over, or body movements, such as their eyes rolling or head turning?; did the seizure happen without warning?; was there any loss of consciousness or altered awareness?; did the person's colour change? For example, did they become paler than usual, flushed, blue or grey? If so, where—the face, lips or hands? On brown or black skin, changes in colour may be easier to see on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, lips, gums and inside the eyelids.; did any parts of their body stiffen, jerk or twitch? If so, which parts?; did the person's breathing change?; did they perform any actions, such as mumble, wander about or fumble with clothing?; how long did the seizure last?; did the person lose control of their bladder or bowel?; did they bite their tongue?; how were they after the seizure?; and did they need to sleep? If so, for how long?\n\n**Keeping a seizure diary:**\nIf you have epilepsy, it can be helpful to record the details of your seizures in a diary.","category":"Neurological Conditions","tags":["seizure","fit","epilepsy","convulsions","first aid","emergency","recovery position","consciousness","breathing difficulties","care plan","emergency medicine","epilepsy bracelet","seizure diary","neurological","unconsciousness","bladder control","bowel control","tongue biting","999","ambulance","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/what-to-do-if-someone-has-a-seizure-fit/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_030","title":"Brain Tumours","body":"A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way.\n\n**Grades and types of brain tumour:**\nBrain tumours are graded according to how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. Grade 1 and 2 tumours are low grade, and grade 3 and 4 tumours are high grade. There are 2 main types of brain tumours: non-cancerous (benign) brain tumours – these are low grade (grade 1 or 2), which means they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment; and cancerous (malignant) brain tumours – these are high grade (grade 3 or 4) and either start in the brain (primary tumours) or spread into the brain from elsewhere (secondary tumours); they're more likely to grow back after treatment.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain affected. Common symptoms include: headaches; seizures (fits); persistently feeling sick (nausea), being sick (vomiting) and drowsiness; mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality; progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body; and vision or speech problems. Sometimes you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may develop very slowly over time.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if you have these types of symptoms, particularly if you have a headache that feels different from the type of headache you usually get, or if headaches are getting worse. You may not have a brain tumour, but these types of symptoms should be checked. If the GP cannot identify a more likely cause of your symptoms, they may refer you to a doctor who specialises in the brain and nervous system (neurologist) for further assessment and tests, such as a brain scan.\n\n**Who's affected:**\nBrain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. More than 12,000 people are diagnosed with a primary brain tumour in the UK each year, of which about half are cancerous. Many others are diagnosed with a secondary brain tumour.\n\n**Causes and risks:**\nThe cause of most brain tumours is unknown, but there are several risk factors that may increase your chances of developing a brain tumour. Risk factors include: age – the risk of getting a brain tumour increases with age (most brain tumours happen in older adults aged 85 to 89), although some types of brain tumour are more common in children; radiation – exposure to radiation accounts for a very small number of brain tumours; some types of brain tumours are more common in people who have had radiotherapy, or very rarely, CT scans or X-rays of the head; and family history and genetic conditions – some genetic conditions are known to increase the risk of getting a brain tumour, including tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2 and Turner syndrome.\n\n**Treating brain tumours:**\nIf you have a brain tumour, your treatment will depend on: the type of tumour; where it is in your brain; how big it is and how far it's spread; how abnormal the cells are; and your overall health and fitness. Treatments for brain tumours include: steroids; medicines to help with symptoms; surgery; radiotherapy; and chemotherapy. After being diagnosed with a brain tumour, steroids may be prescribed to help reduce swelling around the tumour. Other medicines can be used to help with other symptoms of brain tumours, such as anti-epileptic medicines for seizures and painkillers for headaches. Surgery is often used to remove brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much abnormal tissue as safely as possible. It's not always possible to remove all of a tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed to treat any abnormal cells left behind. Treatment for non-cancerous tumours is often successful and a full recovery is possible. Sometimes there's a small chance the tumour could return, so you may need regular follow-up appointments to monitor this.\n\n**Outlook:**\nIf you have a brain tumour, your outlook will depend on several factors, including: your age; the type of tumour you have; where it is in your brain; how effective the treatment is; and your general health. Survival rates are difficult to predict because brain tumours are uncommon and there are many different types. Your doctor will be able to give you more information about your outlook. Generally, around 17 out of every 100 people with a cancerous brain tumour will survive for 5 years or more after being diagnosed.","category":"Cancer","tags":["brain tumour","brain tumor","primary brain tumour","secondary brain tumour","benign tumour","malignant tumour","cancer","neurology","headaches","seizures","fits","nausea","vomiting","drowsiness","memory problems","personality changes","paralysis","weakness","vision problems","speech problems","radiotherapy","chemotherapy","surgery","steroids","anti-epileptic medicines","risk factors","radiation","genetic conditions","tuberous sclerosis","neurofibromatosis","Turner syndrome","prognosis","survival rates","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/brain-tumours/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_031","title":"Antibiotics","body":"Antibiotics are used to treat or prevent some types of bacterial infection. They work by killing bacteria or preventing them from spreading. But they do not work for everything. Many mild bacterial infections get better on their own without using antibiotics. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections such as colds and flu, and most coughs. Antibiotics are no longer routinely used to treat chest infections, ear infections in children, or sore throats. When it comes to antibiotics, take your doctor's advice on whether you need them or not. Antibiotic resistance is a big problem – taking antibiotics when you do not need them can mean they will not work for you in the future.\n\n**When antibiotics are needed:**\nAntibiotics may be used to treat bacterial infections that: are unlikely to clear up without antibiotics; could take too long to clear without treatment; carry a risk of more serious complications; or could infect others. You may still be infectious after starting a course of antibiotics. Depending on the infection and how it's treated, it can take between 48 hours and 14 days to stop being infectious. Ask a GP or pharmacist for advice. People at a high risk of infection may also be given antibiotics as a precaution, known as antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\n**How to take antibiotics:**\nTake antibiotics as directed on the packet or the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine, or as instructed by your GP or pharmacist. Antibiotics can come as: tablets, capsules or a liquid that you drink – these can be used to treat most types of mild to moderate infections in the body; creams, lotions, sprays and drops – these are often used to treat skin infections and eye or ear infections; and injections – these can be given as an injection or through a drip directly into the blood or muscle, and are used for more serious infections.\n\n**Missing a dose:**\nIf you forget to take a dose of your antibiotics, check the patient information leaflet that came with your medicine to find out what to do. In most cases, you can take the dose you missed as soon as you remember and then continue to take your course of antibiotics as normal. But if it's almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n\n**Accidentally taking an extra dose:**\nThere's an increased risk of side effects if you take 2 doses closer together than recommended. Accidentally taking 1 extra dose of your antibiotic is unlikely to cause you any serious harm, but it will increase your chances of getting side effects, such as pain in your stomach, diarrhoea, and feeling or being sick. If you accidentally take more than 1 extra dose of your antibiotic, are worried or you get severe side effects, speak to your GP or call NHS 111 as soon as possible.\n\n**Side effects:**\nAs with any medicine, antibiotics can cause side effects. Most antibiotics do not cause problems if they're used properly and serious side effects are rare. The common side effects include: being sick; feeling sick; bloating and indigestion; and diarrhoea. Some people may have an allergic reaction to antibiotics, especially penicillin and another type of antibiotic called cephalosporins. In very rare cases, this can lead to a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), which is a medical emergency. Call 999 or go to A&E now if you get a skin rash that may include itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin; you're wheezing; you get tightness in the chest or throat; you have trouble breathing or talking; or your mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat start swelling.\n\n**Considerations and interactions:**\nSome antibiotics are not suitable for people with certain medical problems, or women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare professional if you're pregnant or breastfeeding so they can prescribe the most suitable antibiotic for you. Only ever take antibiotics prescribed for you – never \"borrow\" them from a friend or family member. Some antibiotics do not mix well with other medicines, such as the contraceptive pill and alcohol. Read the information leaflet that comes with your medicine carefully and discuss any concerns with your pharmacist or GP.\n\n**Types of antibiotics:**\nThere are hundreds of different types of antibiotics, but most of them can be classified into 6 groups. Penicillins (such as penicillin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin) – widely used to treat a variety of infections, including skin infections, chest infections and urinary tract infections. Cephalosporins (such as cefalexin) – used to treat a wide range of infections, but some are also effective for treating more serious infections, such as sepsis and meningitis. Aminoglycosides (such as gentamicin and tobramycin) – tend to only be used in hospital to treat very serious illnesses such as sepsis, as they can cause serious side effects, including hearing loss and kidney damage; they're usually given by injection, but may be given as drops for some ear or eye infections. Tetracyclines (such as tetracycline, doxycycline and lymecycline) – can be used to treat a wide range of infections, but are commonly used to treat acne and rosacea. Macrolides (such as azithromycin, erythromycin and clarithromycin) – can be particularly useful for treating lung and chest infections, or as an alternative for people with a penicillin allergy, or to treat penicillin-resistant strains of bacteria. Fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) – are broad-spectrum antibiotics that were once used to treat a wide range of infections, especially respiratory and urinary tract infections; these antibiotics are no longer used routinely because of the risk of serious side effects. Other antibiotics include chloramphenicol (used for eye and ear infections), fusidic acid (used for skin and eye infections), and nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim (used for urinary tract infections).","category":"Medications","tags":["antibiotics","bacterial infection","antibiotic resistance","antibiotic prophylaxis","tablets","capsules","liquid antibiotics","creams","lotions","sprays","drops","injections","missed dose","side effects","allergic reaction","anaphylaxis","pregnancy","breastfeeding","drug interactions","penicillins","cephalosporins","aminoglycosides","tetracyclines","macrolides","fluoroquinolones","chloramphenicol","fusidic acid","nitrofurantoin","trimethoprim","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/antibiotics/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_032","title":"Menstrual Cycle: What's Normal, What's Not","body":"Your menstrual cycle can say a lot about your health. Understanding what's typical for you helps you notice important changes — such as a missed period or unusual bleeding — and know when to discuss concerns with a healthcare professional.\n\n**Overview:**\nThe menstrual cycle is the monthly series of changes the body goes through to prepare for pregnancy. Each month, one ovary releases an egg (ovulation). Hormonal changes at this time prepare the uterus for pregnancy. If the egg isn't fertilized, the uterine lining sheds through the vagina: this is a menstrual period.\n\n**What's typical?**\nA cycle is counted from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. Menstrual bleeding might happen every 21 to 35 days and last 2 to 7 days. Long cycles are common during the first few years after menstruation begins, but cycles tend to shorten and become more regular with age. Your period might be light or heavy, painful or pain-free, long or short, and still be considered typical. Within a broad range, \"typical\" is what's typical for you. Certain birth control methods, such as extended-cycle pills and intrauterine devices (IUDs), can change menstrual patterns. Approaching menopause can also make cycles irregular again, but the risk of uterine cancer increases with age, so discuss any irregular bleeding around menopause with your healthcare provider.\n\n**Tracking your cycle:**\nTo find out what's typical for you, keep a calendar of your menstrual cycle. Track your start date for several months to identify regularity. If you're worried about your periods, also track: end date; flow (heaviness, frequency of pad/tampon changes, clots); bleeding changes (between periods); pain (severity, changes); and other changes (mood, behavior, new circumstances around period changes).\n\n**Causes of irregularities:**\nIrregular menstrual cycles have many causes, including: pregnancy or breast-feeding (missed periods, delayed return after pregnancy); eating disorders, extreme weight loss or too much exercise; polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which may include irregular periods and ovarian follicles seen on ultrasound; premature ovarian failure (primary ovarian insufficiency) with irregular or occasional periods before age 40; pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of reproductive organs causing irregular bleeding; and uterine fibroids, which are noncancerous growths that can cause heavy, prolonged periods.\n\n**Prevention and management:**\nBirth control pills may help regulate irregular cycles. Progestin-containing devices can lighten periods and ease cramping. Treating underlying conditions (e.g., eating disorders) may help, though some irregularities can't be prevented. Talk to your healthcare provider if: periods stop for more than 90 days and you're not pregnant; previously regular periods become irregular; bleeding lasts more than seven days; bleeding is heavier than usual or soaks more than one pad or tampon every hour or two; cycles are less than 21 days or more than 35 days apart; you bleed between periods; you develop severe pain during periods; or you suddenly get a fever and feel sick after using tampons.","category":"Women's Health","tags":["menstrual cycle","period tracking","menstrual irregularities","ovulation","pregnancy","breastfeeding","PCOS","premature ovarian failure","pelvic inflammatory disease","uterine fibroids","birth control","menopause","women's health"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menstrual-cycle/art-20047186","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_033","title":"Menopause","body":"Menopause is when menstrual periods stop for good. It's diagnosed after 12 consecutive months without a period, vaginal bleeding or spotting. Menopause can happen in the 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States. Menopause is natural, yet physical symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats) and emotional changes can disrupt sleep, lower energy or affect mood. Treatments range from lifestyle changes to hormone therapy.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMost often, menopause happens over time. The months or years leading up to menopause are called perimenopause or the menopausal transition. Hormone levels vary during this time, which can last 2 to 8 years (average four). Hormone changes can cause irregular periods, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and brain fog. Periods often skip months before stopping. You can still get pregnant during perimenopause; consider a pregnancy test if unsure. See a healthcare professional if you bleed after menopause.\n\n**Causes:**\nMenopause can result from:\n- Natural hormone decline: Ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone beginning in the late 30s, leading to changes in periods and eventual cessation around age 51.\n- Surgery removing the ovaries (oophorectomy): Causes immediate menopause with abrupt hormone drop and potentially severe symptoms. Hysterectomy without ovary removal stops periods but ovaries continue hormone production for a time.\n- Chemotherapy and radiation: Cancer treatments can trigger menopause symptoms during or after treatment. Periods sometimes return, so birth control might still be needed. Radiation aimed at the pelvis, abdomen or lower spine can induce menopause; other sites usually do not.\n- Primary ovarian insufficiency: About 1% experience menopause before age 40 due to ovaries not producing typical hormone levels (gene changes, autoimmune disease). Hormone therapy is often suggested until the typical menopause age to protect the brain, heart and bones.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nEveryone assigned female at birth goes through menopause; age is the main risk factor. Other risk factors include ovary removal surgery and certain cancer treatments.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nSymptoms often indicate menopause. Tests usually aren't needed, but blood tests may assess hormone levels if needed: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) increases and estrogen (estradiol) decreases during menopause; thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be measured because hyperthyroidism can mimic menopause symptoms. Home urine FSH tests can't definitively diagnose menopause because levels fluctuate.\n\n**Treatment:**\nMenopause itself needs no treatment, but therapies can ease symptoms and manage associated conditions:\n- Hormone therapy: Estrogen therapy (with progestin if uterus intact) relieves hot flashes and slows bone loss. Used at the lowest effective dose near menopause onset.\n- Vaginal estrogen: Creams, tablets or rings relieve vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms.\n- Prasterone (Intrarosa): A DHEA insert that helps with vaginal dryness and pain during intercourse.\n- Low-dose antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs): Help manage hot flashes for those who cannot take estrogen.\n- Gabapentin: Reduces hot flashes, useful for nighttime symptoms or when estrogen isn't an option.\n- Clonidine: May reduce hot flashes but is less commonly used due to side effects.\n- Fezolinetant (Veozah): A nonhormonal prescription for hot flashes; may cause abdominal pain, liver issues or sleep disturbances.\n- Oxybutynin: Treats overactive bladder, may help with hot flashes but can affect cognition in older adults.\n- Osteoporosis medicines and vitamin D: Prevent or treat bone loss.\n- Ospemifene: An oral SERM for painful intercourse; not suitable for those with breast cancer risk.\nReview treatment choices with your healthcare professional regularly as needs may change.\n\n**Complications:**\nAfter menopause, risks increase for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis (bone loss leading to fractures), urinary incontinence, sexual difficulties (vaginal dryness, decreased libido), and weight gain due to slower metabolism. Regular wellness visits and medical care before, during and after menopause are recommended.","category":"Women's Health","tags":["menopause","perimenopause","hot flashes","vaginal dryness","irregular periods","hormone therapy","estrogen","progesterone","oophorectomy","hysterectomy","chemotherapy","radiation therapy","primary ovarian insufficiency","osteoporosis","cardiovascular disease","urinary incontinence","mood changes","gabapentin","clonidine","fezolinetant","oxybutynin","prasterone","ospemifene","women's health"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_034","title":"Alzheimer's Disease","body":"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. It begins with a buildup of proteins (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) in the brain, causing brain cells to die and the brain to shrink over time. About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease, and more than 70% are age 75 and older. Globally, 60% to 70% of the 55 million people with dementia are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. Early symptoms often involve forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, serious memory loss and difficulty doing everyday tasks develop. There is no cure, and advanced stages can lead to complications such as dehydration, poor nutrition or infection that may result in death. Medicines may improve symptoms or slow decline, and programs and services can support people with the disease and their caregivers.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMemory loss is the key symptom. Early on, people may struggle to remember recent events or conversations. As Alzheimer's progresses, memory gets worse and other symptoms appear:\n- Repeat statements and questions.\n- Forget conversations, appointments or events.\n- Misplace items in odd places.\n- Get lost in familiar places.\n- Forget names of family members or everyday objects.\n- Have trouble finding words or following conversations.\n\n**Thinking and reasoning:**\nTrouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts (e.g., numbers). Managing finances, multitasking and recognizing numbers become difficult.\n\n**Judgment and decisions:**\nDifficulties making sensible decisions, solving everyday problems, or judging social situations (e.g., clothing for the weather, driving decisions).\n\n**Planning and familiar tasks:**\nRoutine multi-step tasks become hard. Cooking meals, playing games or basic tasks like dressing and bathing can be affected as the disease advances.\n\n**Personality and behavior changes:**\nDepression, loss of interest, social withdrawal, mood swings, distrust, anger or aggression, sleep changes, wandering, loss of inhibitions, and delusions.\n\n**Preserved skills:**\nSome abilities such as reading, listening to music, storytelling, singing, dancing or crafts may remain longer because they're managed by brain areas affected later.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nOther conditions can cause memory loss or dementia-like symptoms and may be treatable. Talk to a healthcare professional if you're concerned about your memory or thinking skills, or about those of a family member or friend.","category":"Neurology","tags":["Alzheimer's disease","dementia","memory loss","cognitive decline","neurodegenerative","amyloid plaques","neurofibrillary tangles","behavior changes","caregiving","neurology"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_035","title":"Migraine","body":"A migraine usually feels like a severe headache with throbbing pain on one side. It's common, and there are steps you can try to help manage it.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nTypical symptoms include a bad headache with throbbing pain on one side of the head. Before a migraine, you may feel very tired, yawn a lot, crave certain foods, feel thirsty, notice mood changes, have a stiff neck, or pee more. Aura warnings can include visual changes (zigzag lines, flashing lights), numbness or tingling, dizziness, or difficulty speaking. Aura symptoms should not last more than an hour. Migraine types include migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and silent migraine (aura without headache).\n\nMigraines usually last 2 hours to 3 days, with some symptoms starting up to 2 days before the headache and lingering after. Some people have frequent migraines; others rarely do. Menstrual migraines are common. Most people find migraines improve with age.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSee a GP if migraines are severe, worsening, lasting longer than usual, occur more than once a week, are hard to control, or happen regularly before/during your period.\n\n**Urgent advice:**\nAsk for an urgent GP appointment or contact NHS 111 if a migraine lasts longer than 72 hours, aura symptoms last more than an hour, or you are pregnant or recently had a baby.\n\n**Emergency (999):**\nCall 999 if you or your child has a sudden, extremely painful headache; trouble speaking or remembering; loss or changes in vision; drowsiness or confusion; seizure; very high temperature with meningitis symptoms; or weakness in the arms, legs, or face on one side.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTreatments include painkillers (ibuprofen, paracetamol), triptans, and anti-sickness medicines. You may need to try different combinations. Lifestyle changes (regular meals, reduced caffeine) can help. Additional therapies include relaxation techniques, acupuncture, and gepant medicines. If treatments fail or symptoms worsen, referral to a specialist may be offered. Avoid frequent high-dose painkillers, as they can make migraines harder to treat.\n\n**Causes and triggers:**\nThe exact cause is unknown, but migraines are more likely if a close family member has them. Triggers may include menstruation, anxiety, depression, stress, tiredness, skipping meals, too much caffeine, and lack of exercise. Keeping a migraine diary can help identify triggers.\n\n**Self-care:**\nDuring a migraine, try resting in a dark room, avoid known triggers, stay hydrated, limit caffeine and alcohol, maintain a healthy weight, eat regularly, exercise, sleep well, and manage stress.","category":"Neurology","tags":["migraine","headache","neurology","aura","menstrual migraine","triptans","gepants","pain management","migraine triggers"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/migraine/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_036","title":"Tuberculosis","body":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious illness that mainly affects the lungs, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. TB spreads when someone with active disease coughs, sneezes or sings, releasing tiny droplets that others can inhale. Crowded living conditions and weakened immune systems (e.g., HIV/AIDS) increase the risk. Antibiotics can treat TB, but some strains are drug-resistant.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nTB infection has three stages:\n- **Primary infection:** Immune cells capture the germs; most people have no symptoms, although some may experience low fever, tiredness or cough.\n- **Latent TB infection:** The immune system walls off the germs; there are no symptoms.\n- **Active TB disease:** Occurs when the immune system fails to control the infection. Symptoms of pulmonary TB develop gradually over weeks and can include cough, coughing up blood or mucus, chest pain, pain with breathing or coughing, fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, tiredness and general malaise.\n\n**Extrapulmonary TB:**\nTB can spread beyond the lungs (kidneys, liver, meninges, heart muscle, genitals, lymph nodes, bones and joints, skin, blood vessel walls, larynx). Symptoms vary by location but may include fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite, tiredness, general discomfort and localized pain.\n\n**Active TB in children:**\n- Teenagers: Similar symptoms to adults.\n- Ages 1–12: Persistent fever, weight loss.\n- Infants: Poor growth/weight gain, lethargy, fussiness, vomiting, poor feeding, bulging soft spot on the head, poor reflexes.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nSee a healthcare professional if symptoms do not improve after a few days of rest. Seek emergency care for chest pain, sudden severe headache, confusion, seizures or breathing difficulty.

Most people can manage it with pharmacy medicines.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Sneezing.\n- Itchy nose.\n- Runny or blocked nose.\n- Itchy, red, watery eyes.\n- Cough.\n- Itchy roof of the mouth.\nSymptoms usually appear within minutes of exposure to an allergen.\n\n**Causes:**\nAllergic rhinitis results from an allergic reaction to triggers such as pollen (hay fever), house dust mites, pet dander, mould, or occupational exposures (wood dust, flour dust, latex). Family history of allergies, eczema or asthma increases risk. It differs from non-allergic rhinitis, which can be caused by infections, temperature changes or humidity.\n\n**Self-care:**\nAvoid known triggers when possible. Pharmacists can advise on antihistamines, decongestant nasal sprays/drops (not for children under 6 and not longer than a week), and saline nasal sprays or rinses. A homemade saltwater rinse can also help. If you have a high temperature or feel unwell, stay home and limit contact with others until you feel better.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSeek medical advice if symptoms worsen, if asthma is also getting worse, if symptoms disrupt sleep or daily life, if triggers are unclear, or if pharmacy treatments are ineffective. A GP may prescribe steroid nasal sprays or other antihistamines, or refer you to a specialist for further testing and treatment.\n\n**Prevention tips:**\nDo: wear wraparound sunglasses to block pollen; use hypoallergenic bedding and wash it regularly at 60°C or above; dust with a damp cloth; vacuum with a HEPA filter; wash pets at least every two weeks and groom them outside; clean pets' bedding and furniture they use; keep your home dry, well ventilated, and address damp or condensation.\nDon't: allow pets in bedrooms; go outside or dry clothes outdoors when pollen counts are high if possible.","category":"Allergy","tags":["allergic rhinitis","hay fever","allergy","pollen","dust mites","pet dander","mould","antihistamines","nasal spray","self-care","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/allergic-rhinitis/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_038","title":"COPD","body":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an ongoing lung condition caused by lung damage that leads to swelling and irritation in the airways, limiting airflow (obstruction). Symptoms include trouble breathing, daily cough with mucus, and wheezing. COPD is most often due to long-term exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke, fumes, dust or chemicals. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the two most common forms, usually occurring together. COPD can worsen over time, but it is treatable, and proper management can control symptoms, improve quality of life, and lower risks of heart disease and lung cancer.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCOPD symptoms often appear after significant lung damage and worsen over time. They include:\n- Shortness of breath, especially during activity.\n- Wheezing or whistling breath sounds.\n- Chronic cough producing clear, white, yellow or greenish mucus.\n- Chest tightness or heaviness.\n- Fatigue.\n- Frequent lung infections.\n- Unintended weight loss as the condition worsens.\n- Swelling in ankles, feet or legs.\n\nExacerbations are episodes when symptoms worsen beyond usual day-to-day variation, triggered by smells, cold air, pollution, colds or infections. Signs include harder breathing, more chest tightness, increased coughing, more or thicker mucus, and fever.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nConsult a healthcare professional if symptoms don’t improve or get worse, or if there are signs of infection (fever or changes in mucus). Seek emergency care for severe breathlessness, blue lips or nail beds, rapid heartbeat, or confusion.\n\n**Causes:**\nIn developed countries, the main cause is tobacco smoking. In developing regions, exposure to fumes from burning fuel for cooking/heating in poorly ventilated homes is common. Long-term workplace exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dust also causes COPD. Not everyone who smokes develops COPD, pointing to other contributing factors such as genetics.\n\n**How the lungs are affected:**\nAir travels through the trachea and bronchi, which branch into smaller bronchioles ending in alveoli (tiny air sacs). Alveoli walls contain blood vessels to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Elasticity allows old air to exit so fresh air can enter.\n\n**Airway obstruction mechanisms:**\n- **Emphysema:** Damage to alveolar walls and elastic fibers creates large air spaces, reducing surface area for gas exchange and trapping old air.\n- **Chronic bronchitis:** Inflammation and narrowing of bronchi lead to thickened airways and excess mucus, limiting airflow and causing chronic cough.\n\n**Irritants:**\nLong-term cigarette smoking is the top cause, but cigar, pipe, marijuana smoke, secondhand smoke, air pollution, and workplace irritants also contribute. Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a genetic condition, accounts for about 1% of cases.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Tobacco smoke (including secondhand exposure).\n- Asthma (especially if combined with smoking).\n- Workplace exposure to fumes/dusts.\n- Fumes from burning fuel for cooking/heating.\n- Genetics (AAT deficiency, other genetic predispositions).\n\n**Complications:**\n- Respiratory infections (colds, flu, pneumonia).\n- Heart disease (including heart attacks).\n- Lung cancer.\n- Pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in lung arteries).\n- Anxiety and depression due to breathing difficulty and activity limitations.\n\n**Prevention:**\nMost COPD cases are preventable by avoiding smoking. Quitting smoking slows disease progression. Protect against workplace irritants with proper ventilation and protective gear. Reduce complications by quitting smoking, staying current on flu, pneumococcal, COVID-19, and RSV vaccines, and addressing mental health concerns.","category":"Respiratory Diseases","tags":["COPD","chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","emphysema","chronic bronchitis","smoking","respiratory disease","lung damage","wheezing","shortness of breath","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_039","title":"Sleep Apnoea","body":"Sleep apnoea is when breathing stops and starts during sleep. The most common type is obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It needs treatment because it can lead to serious problems.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMainly occur during sleep and include breathing stopping and starting, gasping/snorting/choking noises, frequent waking, and loud snoring. Daytime symptoms include severe tiredness, poor concentration, mood swings, and morning headaches. It can be hard to detect; having someone observe your sleep may help.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSeek medical advice if your breathing stops and starts during sleep, you make gasping/snorting/choking noises, or you feel very tired during the day. Bring someone who has observed your symptoms if possible.\n\n**Testing:**\nA GP may refer you to a sleep clinic. You’ll use devices to monitor breathing and heart rate overnight at home or in the clinic. Results show whether you have sleep apnoea and how severe it is based on the AHI score (5–14 mild, 15–30 moderate, over 30 severe).\n\n**Treatment:**\nLifestyle changes (weight loss, quitting smoking, reducing alcohol) may help. Many people need continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): a machine that pumps air through a mask to keep airways open, improve sleep quality, reduce tiredness, and lower risks such as high blood pressure. CPAP works best if used every night; tell your doctor if it’s uncomfortable. Other treatments include mandibular advancement devices (gum shield-like) and surgery (e.g., removing large tonsils).\n\n**Self-help tips:**\nDo: lose weight if overweight; exercise regularly; practice good sleep habits (dark, quiet bedroom; consistent sleep schedule); sleep on your side (use a tennis ball or special pillow to keep off your back). Don’t: smoke; drink too much alcohol, especially before bed; take sleeping pills unless prescribed, as they can worsen sleep apnoea.\n\n**Complications:**\nUntreated sleep apnoea can cause high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, depression, accidents due to tiredness, and difficulty concentrating.

{"id":"DOC_040","title":"Family Planning and Contraception","body":"Family planning enables people to achieve their desired number of children and determine the spacing of pregnancies through contraceptive use and infertility treatment. Access to family planning supports the human right to make informed choices about sexual and reproductive health and contributes to health, gender equality, education, economic opportunity, and SDG 3.7's goal of universal access to reproductive health care.\n\n**Key facts:**\n- Of 1.9 billion women aged 15–49 in 2021, 1.1 billion needed family planning; 874 million used modern contraception, while 164 million had unmet need.\n- Contraception prevents unintended pregnancies and reduces health risks, particularly for adolescent girls.\n- Multiple temporary (reversible) and permanent contraceptive options exist.\n- Condoms are the only method protecting against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.\n\n**Impact:**\nAccess to family planning reduces pregnancy-related risks, supports education and employment, strengthens health systems, and promotes economic growth. Modern contraceptive use is projected to expand by 70 million women by 2030.\n\n**Barriers:**\nChallenges include limited method availability, especially in low-resource or rural areas; age, income, and marital status restrictions; fear of side effects; misinformation; social or religious opposition; poor service quality; provider bias; and gender inequality that may require partner consent or lead to stigma.\n\n**Contraceptive methods:**\nWHO-approved methods include long-acting options (implants, IUDs, sterilization), regular-use methods (pills, injections, patches, vaginal rings), barrier methods (condoms), and less reliable methods (fertility awareness, withdrawal). Choice depends on individual health, preferences, and needs, with health worker guidance recommended.\n\n**Infertility:**\nInfertility affects about 1 in 6 adults over a lifetime. Causes include infections, medical conditions, environmental and lifestyle factors, and can affect all genders. Women often face greater social blame, causing stigma and distress. Treating infertility is part of comprehensive family planning. Modern contraceptives do not cause infertility.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO supports universal access to reproductive health services, develops evidence-based guidelines on contraception safety and service delivery, ensures human rights in programmes, assists countries in adapting tools, and advances new contraceptive technologies. WHO conducts research to improve access to information and services.","category":"Reproductive Health","tags":["family planning","contraception","sexual and reproductive health","WHO","modern contraceptives","infertility","SDG 3.7","public health","gender equality"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception","year":2025}

Common symptoms include upset stomach, vomiting, loose or bloody stools, stomach pain or cramps, and fever. Symptoms usually begin within hours or days, but can take weeks depending on the cause. Less often, the nervous system is affected, leading to blurred or double vision, headaches, paralysis, tingling, numbness, or weakness.\n\n**When to seek medical care:**\n- **Infants and children:** Contact a healthcare professional if vomiting and loose stools occur with behavior changes, extreme thirst, little or no urine, dizziness, diarrhea lasting more than a day, frequent vomiting, blood or pus in stools, severe abdominal or rectal pain, any fever in children under 2, fever ≥102°F (38.9°C) in older children, or history of other medical problems.\n- **Adults:** Seek care if there are nervous system symptoms (blurry vision, muscle weakness, skin tingling), mental changes, temperature ≥103°F (39.4°C), frequent vomiting, diarrhea lasting more than three days, or signs of dehydration (intense thirst, dry mouth, little/no urination, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness).\n\n**Causes:**\nContaminants include bacteria, viruses, intestinal parasites, toxins, toxin-producing bacteria, and toxin-producing molds.\n- Foodborne illness: illness from any contaminated food or drink.\n- Food poisoning: illness from toxins in food (a subset of foodborne illness).\n\n**How contamination occurs:**\nFood can be tainted during growing, harvesting, processing, storing, shipping, or preparation. Causes include poor handwashing (fecal contamination), unclean utensils or surfaces, improper storage (leaving food at room temperature too long, keeping in refrigerator/freezer that’s too warm), among others.\n\n**Complications:**\nSevere dehydration, bloodstream infections, kidney failure, chronic arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and breathing problems (e.g., from botulism) can occur.\n\n**Prevention:**\n- **Cleaning:** Wash hands for 20 seconds with soap and water; rinse fruits/vegetables; clean utensils with hot soapy water after contact with raw foods; clean refrigerators regularly (baking soda solution, bleach for mold).\n- **Preparing/eating/storing:** Keep raw foods separate; thaw, cook, and store foods safely; cook meats to safe temperatures; refrigerate or freeze leftovers promptly; discard questionable or moldy foods (with allowances for trimming mold from firm, low-moisture foods).\n- **High-risk groups (pregnant people, young children, older adults, immunocompromised):** Avoid raw or undercooked meats, fish, shellfish, eggs (and foods containing raw eggs), raw sprouts, unpasteurized juices/milk, soft cheeses or unpasteurized cheeses, refrigerated pates/meat spreads, and uncooked deli meats unless reheated.\n\n**Safety tips:**\nPractice proper hand hygiene, prevent cross-contamination, cook to safe temperatures, refrigerate leftovers promptly, and discard unsafe foods.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["food poisoning","foodborne illness","gastroenteritis","contaminated food","dehydration","food safety","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20356230","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_042","title":"Epilepsy","body":"Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable brain disease affecting all ages and characterized by recurrent seizures due to excessive electrical discharges in the brain. Around 50 million people worldwide live with epilepsy, and nearly 80% reside in low- and middle-income countries. Up to 70% of people with epilepsy could be seizure-free with proper diagnosis and treatment, yet three quarters of those in low-income settings lack needed care. People with epilepsy face triple the risk of premature death, and stigma and discrimination remain widespread.\n\n**Overview:**\nSeizures can involve part of the body (partial) or the entire body (generalized) and may include loss of consciousness or control of bladder/bowel function. Seizures range from brief lapses in attention or muscle jerks to prolonged convulsions, occurring from less than once a year to multiple times daily. Epilepsy is defined by two or more unprovoked seizures. Although recorded since 4000 BCE, fear and misunderstanding persist. Stigma can severely impact quality of life for individuals and families.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nSeizure manifestations depend on the brain region affected and its spread, causing temporary symptoms such as loss of awareness, disturbances in movement, sensation, mood or cognition. People with epilepsy often have higher rates of physical injuries (e.g. fractures) and psychological conditions (anxiety, depression). Many epilepsy-related deaths, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, are preventable (falls, drowning, burns, prolonged seizures).\n\n**Rates of disease:**\nGlobal active epilepsy prevalence is 4–10 per 1000 people. About 5 million people are diagnosed annually. Incidence is ~49 per 100 000 in high-income countries and up to 139 per 100 000 in low- and middle-income countries, due to higher risks (malaria, neurocysticercosis, traffic injuries, birth injuries) and variable medical infrastructure. Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**Causes:**\nEpilepsy is not contagious. Causes span structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune and unknown categories. Examples include prenatal or perinatal brain damage (oxygen deprivation, trauma, low birth weight), congenital abnormalities/genetic conditions, severe head injuries, strokes, brain infections (meningitis, encephalitis, neurocysticercosis), certain genetic syndromes and brain tumours. About 50% of cases have no identifiable cause.\n\n**Treatment:**\nSeizures are controllable in up to 70% of cases with appropriate antiseizure medicines; discontinuation may be considered after 2 seizure-free years. Treatment gaps remain high; in many low-income settings, 75% lack therapy, with public-sector availability of generic antiseizure medicines below 50%. Most cases can be diagnosed and managed at the primary care level. Training primary health care providers has proven effective in reducing treatment gaps. Surgery may benefit those not responding to medicines.\n\n**Prevention:**\nAbout 25% of cases are preventable. Key strategies include preventing head injuries (reducing falls, traffic accidents), ensuring adequate perinatal care, managing fevers in children to avoid febrile seizures, reducing stroke risk (controlling blood pressure, diabetes, obesity; avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol), and preventing central nervous system infections (e.g. eliminating parasites causing neurocysticercosis).\n\n**Social and economic impacts:**\nEpilepsy accounts for >0.5% of the global disease burden and carries significant healthcare, mortality and productivity costs. Out-of-pocket expenditures and lost income can heavily burden households. Public financing of epilepsy care in India proved cost-effective and reduced financial strain. Stigma, misconceptions (e.g. epilepsy is incurable, contagious), and discrimination often surpass seizure impacts, isolating individuals and deterring treatment.\n\n**Human rights:**\nPeople with epilepsy face restricted educational and occupational opportunities, denial of driving licences, and reduced access to insurance. Some laws still allow annulment of marriage or restrict access to public spaces due to epilepsy. Rights-based legislation can prevent discrimination, improve service access, and enhance quality of life.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO’s 2019 report “Epilepsy: a public health imperative” outlined global burden and responses. The Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031 emphasizes shared preventive, pharmacologic and psychosocial strategies. WHO’s technical briefs guide policymakers in reducing epilepsy burden. Initiatives like the Global Campaign Against Epilepsy and programmes in Ghana, Mozambique, Myanmar and Viet Nam have trained health professionals, reduced treatment gaps, and integrated epilepsy care into local systems, demonstrating cost-effective approaches in low-resource settings.","category":"Neurology","tags":["epilepsy","seizures","neurological disorders","antiseizure medicines","WHO","treatment gap","prevention","stigma","human rights"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_043","title":"Schizophrenia","body":"Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health condition that causes psychosis, substantial disability, and wide-ranging impacts on personal, family, social, educational, and occupational life. Stigma, discrimination, and human rights violations remain common, and more than two thirds of people with psychosis worldwide do not receive specialist mental health care. Effective treatment options exist and at least one in three people can fully recover.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSchizophrenia involves marked changes in perception, thinking, behaviour, and affect. Core features include persistent delusions (fixed false beliefs), persistent hallucinations (perceiving stimuli that are not present), and experiences of influence or control where a person feels thoughts or actions are externally governed. Disorganized thinking manifests as jumbled or irrelevant speech, while highly disorganized behaviour may appear bizarre or purposeless. Negative symptoms include very limited speech, restricted emotional expression, inability to feel interest or pleasure, and social withdrawal. Some individuals exhibit extreme agitation, slowed movements, or rigid postures. Cognitive difficulties with memory, attention, and problem-solving are common. Symptom patterns vary: about one third achieve complete remission, while others alternate between exacerbations and remissions or experience gradual worsening.\n\n**Magnitude and impact:**\nRoughly 23 million people worldwide (1 in 345; 0.29%) live with schizophrenia, with adult prevalence at 0.43%. Onset typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood and tends to happen earlier in men. The condition causes marked distress and functional impairment across key life domains. People with schizophrenia die on average nine years earlier than the general population, often from physical illnesses such as cardiovascular, metabolic, or infectious diseases. Human rights abuses are frequent both in institutions and communities. Stigma and discrimination lead to social exclusion and limited access to health care, education, housing, and employment. Emergencies that disrupt social supports and health services can worsen symptoms and heighten vulnerability to neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse, and exclusion.\n\n**Causes:**\nNo single cause is known. Schizophrenia likely arises from interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, while psychosocial influences affect onset and course. Heavy cannabis use is linked to elevated risk. Other contributing factors under study include prenatal and perinatal complications, infections, stress, and social determinants.\n\n**Services:**\nGlobally, most people with schizophrenia lack mental health care. About half of residents in mental hospitals have schizophrenia, yet only 29% of people with psychosis receive specialist care. Resources are often concentrated in institutions that may fail to provide effective care and may violate human rights. Shifting from institutional to community-based mental health services is essential. Effective community options include integration into primary care and general hospitals, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach/home-based support. Active involvement of individuals with schizophrenia, their families, and communities improves support and outcomes.\n\n**Management and support:**\nTreatment should combine evidence-based interventions such as antipsychotic medications, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g., life-skills training). Recovery-oriented services that provide assisted living, supported housing, and supported employment help people maintain independence. Collaborative decision-making that honours personal agency benefits individuals and caregivers.\n\n**WHO response:**\nThe Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030 guides countries on delivering appropriate services and emphasizes transitioning care to community settings. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health seeks to expand access to affordable, quality care for 100 million more people. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) equips non-specialized providers with evidence-based tools to manage priority conditions, including psychosis, and operates in over 100 Member States. The QualityRights Project focuses on improving care quality and protecting human rights in mental health and social care facilities while empowering organizations to advocate for people with psychosocial disabilities. WHO guidance on community mental health services promotes person-centred, rights-based approaches aligned with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["schizophrenia","psychosis","mental disorders","community mental health","WHO","stigma","human rights","mhGAP","recovery"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_044","title":"Oral Health","body":"Oral diseases are largely preventable yet remain one of the most common chronic health burdens worldwide. Nearly 3.7 billion people are affected, and untreated dental caries in permanent teeth is the most prevalent condition tracked by the Global Burden of Disease study. Prevention and treatment are costly, seldom covered by universal health coverage packages, and services are especially limited in low- and middle-income countries. The same commercial and social determinants that drive many noncommunicable diseases—sugar intake, tobacco, alcohol, and poor hygiene—also drive oral conditions.\n\n**Overview:**\nMost oral health issues can be managed if detected early. Common problems include dental caries, periodontal disease, tooth loss, and oral cancers, while other conditions of public-health concern include orofacial clefts, noma, and oro-dental trauma. Urbanization, limited fluoride exposure, high availability of sugary foods and drinks, and constrained access to community oral care services fuel rising prevalence.\n\n**Dental caries:**\nPlaque metabolizes free sugars from foods and drinks into acids that erode teeth over time. High sugar intake, insufficient fluoride exposure, and inadequate plaque removal lead to pain, infection, and potential tooth loss.\n\n**Periodontal disease:**\nThis condition inflames and damages the tissues supporting teeth, presenting with bleeding or swollen gums, pain, and halitosis. Severe disease causes gum detachment, bone loss, and tooth loosening. Over 1 billion cases are estimated globally, largely linked to poor oral hygiene and tobacco use.\n\n**Edentulism (total tooth loss):**\nComplete tooth loss reflects cumulative oral disease, most often from advanced caries and periodontal disease. About 7% of adults aged 20+ and 23% of adults aged 60+ are affected worldwide, leading to psychosocial distress and functional limitations.\n\n**Oral cancer:**\nCancers of the lip, oral cavity, and oropharynx rank 13th globally, with roughly 390 000 new cases and 188 000 deaths in 2022. Rates are higher in men, older adults, and disadvantaged groups. Tobacco, alcohol, and areca nut use are major risk factors, while HPV infections drive a growing share of cases in younger populations in North America and Europe.\n\n**Oro-dental trauma:**\nInjuries to teeth and oral tissues affect about 1 billion people, with ~20% prevalence among children under 12. Malocclusion, unsafe environments, road crashes, and violence contribute. Treatment is expensive, lengthy, and may result in tooth loss and psychosocial impacts.\n\n**Noma:**\nNoma is a rapidly progressive gangrenous disease of the mouth and face, mainly affecting malnourished children aged 2–6 in extreme poverty. Around 140 000 new cases occur annually; without treatment, mortality reaches 90%. Early detection with hygiene measures, antibiotics, and improved nutrition can arrest progression, but survivors often require complex reconstruction.\n\n**Cleft lip and palate:**\nOrofacial clefts occur in roughly 1 in 1000–1500 births. Genetics, maternal undernutrition, tobacco, alcohol, and obesity during pregnancy contribute. Mortality is high in low-income settings without surgical care, but timely surgery enables full rehabilitation.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nMost oral diseases share modifiable risks—tobacco, alcohol, and diets high in free sugars—that also drive cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. Diabetes both influences and is influenced by periodontal disease, and excessive sugar intake links directly to obesity, diabetes, and caries.\n\n**Oral health inequalities:**\nDisease burden disproportionately affects poorer and socially marginalized populations across all ages. Socioeconomic status strongly correlates with oral disease prevalence and severity in high-, middle-, and low-income countries.\n\n**Prevention:**\nPopulation-level actions include promoting diets low in free sugars and high in fruits and vegetables, encouraging water as the primary beverage, eliminating all forms of tobacco (including areca nut chewing), limiting alcohol, and promoting protective gear during sports and cycling to reduce facial injuries. Adequate fluoride exposure and twice-daily brushing with fluoride toothpaste (1000–1500 ppm) are essential preventive measures.\n\n**Access to services:**\nOral health professionals are unevenly distributed, and facilities rarely meet population need. High out-of-pocket costs make oral care one of the leading causes of catastrophic health expenditure, pushing households into financial hardship.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHA74’s 2021 Resolution on oral health calls for shifting from curative to preventive, primary-care–based services and embedding oral health in NCD and UHC agendas. The 2022 Global strategy on oral health and the Global oral health action plan 2023–2030 outline responsibilities for Member States, WHO, partners, civil society, and the private sector. The 2024 Bangkok Declaration (“No Health Without Oral Health”) reinforces oral diseases as a global priority and urges strengthening climate-resilient primary care systems to deliver inclusive, sustainable oral health services.","category":"Oral Health","tags":["oral health","dental caries","periodontal disease","oral cancer","noma","fluoride","noncommunicable diseases","WHO","prevention"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_045","title":"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)","body":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects people during their reproductive years. It typically causes infrequent, prolonged, or irregular menstrual periods and excess androgen levels. Multiple small follicles develop along the outer edge of the ovaries and often fail to release mature eggs. Although the exact cause is unknown, early diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes such as weight management can reduce risks of long-term complications including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Overview:**\nPCOS disrupts normal ovulation. Follicles containing immature eggs accumulate without regularly releasing eggs, leading to ovulatory dysfunction and hormonal imbalances. The condition often presents soon after menarche but may arise later.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nDiagnosis usually requires at least two of the following:\n- Irregular or infrequent menstrual periods, often fewer than nine per year or cycles longer than 35 days.\n- Clinical or biochemical signs of excess androgen (hirsutism, severe acne, male-pattern baldness).\n- Enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles that do not function normally.\nSymptoms tend to be more severe in individuals with obesity. Medical evaluation is recommended for menstrual concerns, infertility, or new androgen-related changes.\n\n**Causes:**\nAlthough etiology remains uncertain, several mechanisms contribute:\n- **Insulin resistance:** Elevated insulin levels stimulate ovarian androgen production and disrupt ovulation. Signs include acanthosis nigricans, increased appetite, and weight gain.\n- **Low-grade inflammation:** Chronic inflammatory responses can drive ovarian androgen production and raise cardiovascular risk.\n- **Heredity:** Genetic predisposition and family history increase susceptibility.\n- **Excess androgen:** Ovaries may produce elevated androgen levels that interfere with follicular maturation and ovulation, promoting hirsutism and acne.\n\n**Complications:**\nUntreated PCOS can lead to infertility, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, miscarriage or preterm birth, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and endometrial cancer. Obesity often coexists and exacerbates these risks.\n","category":"Women's Health","tags":["PCOS","endocrine disorder","infertility","insulin resistance","androgens","women's health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_046","title":"Cavities and Tooth Decay","body":"Cavities are damaged areas of tooth enamel that progress into tiny openings or holes. Without treatment, decay penetrates deeper layers, causing pain, infection, and eventual tooth loss. Tooth decay is among the world’s most common health problems and affects people of all ages, including children and infants. Consistent dental care and oral hygiene are essential for prevention.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nEarly cavities may not cause symptoms. As decay advances, people can experience toothache, sensitivity, sharp pain when eating or drinking hot, cold, or sweet items, visible pits or holes, brown/black/white staining, and pain while biting. Regular dental visits are recommended even when no discomfort is present; prompt evaluation is needed for tooth or mouth pain.\n\n**Causes:**\nCavities develop through a gradual process:\n- **Plaque formation:** Sugars and starches left on teeth feed bacteria, creating sticky plaque that hardens into tartar if not removed.\n- **Plaque attacks:** Bacterial acids erode minerals in enamel, forming micro-openings; once enamel thins, acids reach dentin, which is softer and more sensitive.\n- **Progression:** Bacteria and acid invade the pulp, causing inflammation, nerve compression, pain, and potentially spreading infection to bone and adjacent teeth.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nDecay risk rises with posterior tooth anatomy (grooves and roots), clingy foods (sweets, dried fruit, chips), frequent snacking or sipping sugary/acidic drinks, bedtime baby bottles or constant sippy cups, inadequate brushing, insufficient fluoride exposure, very young or older age, dry mouth, worn fillings or ill-fitting dental devices, gastroesophageal reflux, and eating disorders (vomiting or reduced saliva).\n\n**Complications:**\nUntreated cavities can cause pain, abscesses, swelling, damaged or broken teeth, chewing difficulty, tooth shifting after loss, nutritional problems, or systemic infections. In children, decay in primary teeth may disrupt development and alignment of permanent teeth, impacting growth, appearance, and self-esteem.\n\n**Prevention:**\nKey strategies include brushing twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, cleaning between teeth (floss or interdental cleaners), fluoride mouth rinses for high-risk individuals, routine professional cleanings and exams, dental sealants on molars, drinking fluoridated tap water, limiting snacking and sugary beverages, choosing tooth-healthy foods (fruits, vegetables, unsweetened coffee/tea, sugar-free gum), receiving professional fluoride treatments or custom trays when needed, and using antiseptic rinses (e.g., chlorhexidine) for medical conditions that heighten decay risk. Combining sugar-free gum with prescription fluoride and antibacterial rinses may offer additional benefit, though large amounts of xylitol can cause gastrointestinal upset for some people.","category":"Oral Health","tags":["cavities","tooth decay","dental caries","fluoride","oral hygiene","risk factors","prevention","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cavities/symptoms-causes/syc-20352892","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_047","title":"Common Cold","body":"The common cold is a viral upper respiratory infection that usually clears within 1–2 weeks without medical care. Symptoms develop gradually over 2–3 days and can include a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, sore or hoarse throat, cough, fatigue, and feeling generally unwell. Some people also experience fever, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, or pressure in the ears and face. Children may have longer-lasting symptoms, irritability, feeding and sleeping difficulties, mouth breathing, and vomiting after coughing.\n\n**Cold vs. flu:**\nColds appear gradually, mainly affect the nose and throat, and usually allow people to continue daily activities. Flu begins suddenly within hours, causes more systemic illness, and often leaves people too unwell to function normally.\n\n**Self-care:**\nMost colds can be managed at home. Recommended measures include rest, adequate fluids, nutritious meals, salt-water gargles (not for children), hot lemon and honey drinks, and inhaling steam (sit in a steamy bathroom; do not let children inhale steam from bowls). Avoid smoking, giving aspirin to under-16s, or exposing children to hot steam bowls. Stay home if feverish or too unwell for normal activities.\n\n**Pharmacy support:**\nPharmacists can suggest over-the-counter options such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for aches and fever, age-appropriate decongestants (avoid in children under 6), and vapour rubs for babies and young children. Nasal sprays should not be used beyond one week. Check for duplicate ingredients if combining products, and note that some remedies are unsuitable during pregnancy or childhood. Supplements like vitamin C, echinacea, or garlic have little evidence for prevention or faster recovery.\n\n**When to seek medical advice:**\nContact a GP if fever lasts >3 days, symptoms worsen or persist >10 days, temperature is very high or accompanied by chills, breathing becomes difficult, chest pain occurs, cough lasts >3 weeks, there is concern about a child’s symptoms, or if the person has long-term conditions (e.g., heart, lung, kidney disease, diabetes) or weakened immunity (e.g., chemotherapy). Antibiotics are not recommended because colds are viral.\n\n**Preventing spread:**\nColds spread via droplets from coughs and sneezes and can survive on hands and surfaces for 24 hours. People remain infectious until symptoms resolve (usually 1–2 weeks). Reduce transmission by washing hands frequently with warm water and soap, using tissues to catch coughs/sneezes, and discarding tissues promptly.\n\n**Reducing risk of catching a cold:**\nAvoid sharing towels, cups, or toys with infected individuals, refrain from touching eyes or nose after contact with surfaces, practice good hand hygiene, and maintain general fitness. People can spread the virus from a few days before symptoms begin until recovery. The flu vaccine does not protect against colds.","category":"Respiratory Conditions","tags":["common cold","upper respiratory infection","self-care","pharmacy advice","infection control","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/common-cold/","year":2024}

Treatments depend on the cause and may include antacids, alginates, acid-suppressing medicines, or antibiotics.\n\n**When to seek urgent care:**\nCall 999 or go to A&E if you vomit bright red blood or material that looks like coffee grounds, produce black tarry stools, or develop sudden severe abdominal or chest pain. Do not drive yourself; arrange transport and bring current medications.\n\n**When to seek medical advice:**\n- Ask for an urgent GP appointment or NHS 111 help if you lose appetite, feel full after small meals, lose weight unintentionally, sense a lump in the abdomen, have painful/difficult swallowing, or keep vomiting.\n- See a GP if tummy pain or indigestion lasts longer than a week, worsens, or recurs.\n\n**Common causes:**\nHelicobacter pylori infection, regular use of anti-inflammatory painkillers (ibuprofen, aspirin), excessive alcohol intake, severe stress or illness (e.g., after surgery), and autoimmune conditions targeting the stomach lining.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nGPs may arrange a breath test for H. pylori, stool analysis, or blood tests. Preparation instructions (especially for breath tests) are usually provided about four weeks in advance.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTherapy targets the cause and may involve antibiotics for H. pylori, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, or alginates to suppress or neutralize acid, adjusting painkiller regimens, and stopping alcohol if it triggers symptoms. Untreated gastritis can progress to ulcers. Persistent or severe cases may require referral to a gastroenterologist for gastroscopy.\n\n**Self-care:**\n- **Do:** reduce caffeine intake, elevate the head/shoulders with an extra pillow at night, lose weight if overweight, and consult a doctor about long-term NSAID/aspirin use.\n- **Don’t:** eat within 3–4 hours of bedtime, consume acidic/fizzy/spicy/fatty foods or drinks, drink alcohol, or smoke.\n\n**Pharmacy support:**\nPharmacists can recommend antacids or alginates to shield the stomach and esophagus, and proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid production.

{"id":"DOC_049","title":"Adolescent Pregnancy","body":"Adolescent pregnancy, defined as pregnancy in girls aged 10–19 years, remains a global public health concern with profound health, social and economic consequences. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there were an estimated 21 million pregnancies annually among adolescents aged 15–19 in 2019, half of which were unintended, resulting in about 12 million births. Approximately 55% of unintended pregnancies in adolescents end in abortions, often unsafe in LMICs. Adolescents face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than women aged 20–24, and their babies have greater risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and severe neonatal complications. The adolescent birth rate (ABR) for girls aged 10–14 was 1.5 per 1000 globally in 2023, but reached 4.4 in sub-Saharan Africa and 2.3 in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n**Overview:**\nWhile global ABR has fallen, declines are uneven across regions and within countries, with higher rates among adolescents with limited education or low socioeconomic status. Child marriage, child sexual abuse, limited access to contraceptives, and social pressures to bear children sustain high adolescent pregnancy rates. Barriers include restrictive laws, provider bias, stigma, cost, and inadequate information. WHO supports countries by building evidence, developing policy and programme tools, advocating for adolescent health, and promoting equitable maternal care for pregnant and parenting adolescents.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\n- ABR declined from 64.5 births per 1000 girls aged 15–19 in 2000 to 41.3 in 2023, but sub-Saharan Africa (97.9) and Latin America and the Caribbean (51.4) still have the highest rates.\n- Regional disparities exist (e.g., 97 per 1000 in the WHO African Region vs. 13.1 per 1000 in the European Region in 2023) and intra-country differences are large (e.g., Zambia’s provincial rates ranging 14.9%–42.5% of adolescents who have begun childbearing; the Philippines 3.5%–17.9%).\n- In 2021, sub-Saharan Africa recorded ~6.1 million births among 15–19-year-olds and 332 000 among 10–14-year-olds, compared with 68 000 and 22 000 respectively in Central and South-East Asia.\n\n**Context and drivers:**\n- **Socioeconomic inequities:** Adolescents with less education or low income experience higher pregnancy rates; progress is slow among vulnerable groups, widening inequities.\n- **Child marriage:** An estimated 650 million women were child brides as of 2021; early marriage limits autonomy over timing of childbearing and contraceptive use.\n- **Limited opportunities:** In settings with restricted education/employment prospects, motherhood may be one of few valued roles.\n- **Contraceptive barriers:** Adolescents face limited availability, cost, stigma, restrictive laws (age/marital status), provider bias, side effects, and inconsistent use.\n- **Sexual violence:** About 120 million girls under 20 have experienced sexual violence by non-partners; 1 in 8 children experience sexual abuse before 18, and 1 in 20 girls aged 15–19 report forced sex, increasing unintended pregnancies.\n- **Intimate partner violence:** 24% of adolescent girls aged 15–19 have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner; 16% within the last year, undermining reproductive autonomy.\n\nPreventing adolescent pregnancy aligns with SDG indicators 3.7.2 (adolescent birth rate) and 5.3.1 (child marriage). Strategies increasingly couple pregnancy prevention with improved access to respectful, high-quality maternal care and support for pregnant adolescents, yet access and quality remain inconsistent.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO collaborates with governments and partners to prioritize adolescent health, expand evidence, develop guidance and tools, build capacity, and support national programmes targeting adolescent pregnancy prevention, child marriage reduction, and better care for adolescent parents. Governments and civil society are scaling up interventions, recognizing the urgency of addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health rights.","category":"Reproductive Health","tags":["adolescent pregnancy","adolescent birth rate","child marriage","sexual and reproductive health","WHO","contraceptive access","gender equity"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/adolescent-pregnancy","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_050","title":"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)","body":"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes inappropriately or weakens, allowing stomach contents to flow back into the esophagus. This reflux—acidic or sometimes nonacidic—irritates the lining of the esophagus, producing chronic symptoms commonly known as heartburn. Many people experience occasional reflux, but frequent or persistent episodes define GERD. Most cases improve with lifestyle changes and medicines, though some individuals require surgery.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Chest burning (heartburn) after meals, worse at night or when lying down.\n- Regurgitation of food or sour liquid.\n- Upper abdominal or chest pain.\n- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n- Sensation of a lump in the throat.\nNighttime reflux may add chronic cough, laryngitis, or worsening asthma.\n\n**When to seek care:**\nImmediate medical attention is required for chest pain with shortness of breath or jaw/arm pain, as these could indicate a heart attack. See a healthcare professional for severe or frequent GERD symptoms or if you rely on over-the-counter heartburn medicines more than twice weekly.\n\n**Causes:**\nGERD results from recurrent acid reflux. Normally, the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow food into the stomach and then closes. If it relaxes improperly or weakens, stomach acid flows backward, inflaming the esophageal lining and causing chronic symptoms.\n\n**Risk factors and aggravating behaviors:**\nConditions raising GERD risk include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, connective tissue disorders (e.g., scleroderma), and delayed stomach emptying. Triggers that worsen reflux include smoking, large meals or late eating, fatty or fried foods, alcohol, coffee, and certain medicines such as aspirin.\n\n**Complications:**\n- **Esophagitis:** Chronic acid exposure inflames and erodes esophageal tissue, leading to ulcers that cause pain and swallowing difficulties.\n- **Esophageal stricture:** Scar tissue from acid damage narrows the esophagus, obstructing food passage.\n- **Barrett esophagus:** Long-term acid exposure alters lower esophageal lining cells, increasing the risk of esophageal cancer.","category":"Digestive Disorders","tags":["GERD","acid reflux","esophagitis","Barrett esophagus","hiatal hernia","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_051","title":"Lung Cancer","body":"**Key Facts:**\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women. Smoking is responsible for approximately 85% of all cases. Lung cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages when treatment options are limited. Screening high-risk individuals allows early detection and significantly improves survival rates. Primary prevention, including tobacco control and reducing environmental exposures, can reduce lung cancer incidence.\n\n**Overview:**\nLung cancer occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably in the lungs. Common symptoms include a persistent cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Early medical care is crucial for better outcomes. The main types are non-small cell carcinoma (NSCLC), which grows slowly and is more common, and small cell carcinoma (SCLC), which grows quickly. According to GLOBOCAN 2020 (IARC), lung cancer caused an estimated 1.8 million deaths in 2020. Risk factors include smoking, secondhand smoke, occupational exposures (asbestos, radon, chemicals), air pollution, hereditary syndromes, and chronic lung diseases.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon symptoms of lung cancer include:\n- Persistent cough\n- Chest pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- Coughing up blood (haemoptysis)\n- Fatigue\n- Unexplained weight loss\n- Recurrent lung infections\nEarly symptoms may be mild, causing delayed diagnosis.\n\n**Prevention:**\nAvoiding tobacco use is the most effective way to prevent lung cancer. Other preventable risk factors include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and workplace chemical exposure. Primary prevention focuses on smoking cessation, smoke-free environments, occupational safety, and air quality improvement. Secondary prevention includes screening, especially low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), for high-risk individuals to detect early disease.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nLung cancer diagnosis involves physical examination, imaging (X-rays, CT, MRI), bronchoscopy, tissue biopsy for histopathology, and molecular testing to determine tumour type (NSCLC or SCLC) and guide treatment options.\n\n**Treatment and Care:**\nTreatment depends on cancer type, stage, spread, and patient history. Options include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Surgery is preferred for early-stage disease. Chemotherapy and radiation help shrink tumours. Multidisciplinary teams manage treatment. Supportive care focuses on pain relief, managing symptoms, and improving quality of life.\n\n**Stages of Care:**\n**a) Early-stage disease:** Surgery is the primary treatment when cancer is confined to the lung. Neoadjuvant therapy (before surgery) helps shrink tumours, while adjuvant therapy (after surgery) reduces recurrence risk. Radiation therapy or SBRT may be used when surgery is not possible. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may also be considered.\n\n**b) Advanced disease:** For metastatic lung cancer, treatment focuses on prolonging survival and improving quality of life. Chemotherapy is often first-line. Targeted therapy is used for tumours with specific mutations. Immunotherapy helps the immune system attack cancer cells. Local treatments like radiation or surgery relieve symptoms.\n\n**Clinical Trials:**\nClinical trials offer patients access to new or experimental treatments and help advance lung cancer research.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO works to reduce lung cancer burden through tobacco control, early detection, and improved cancer care. Initiatives include tobacco taxation, advertising bans, graphic health warnings, promoting healthy lifestyles, improving environmental conditions, supporting screening programs, and ensuring equitable access to essential cancer treatments.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["lung cancer","cancer","tobacco control","NSCLC","SCLC","screening","LDCT","chemotherapy","radiotherapy","immunotherapy","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lung-cancer","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_052","title":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)","body":"**Key Facts:**\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and sore throat, though many others can occur. Most people recover without needing hospital treatment, but people with severe symptoms should seek urgent medical care. Over 760 million cases and 6.9 million deaths have been recorded globally since December 2019, although actual numbers may be higher. Over 13 billion vaccine doses have been administered as of June 2023.\n\n**Overview:**\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and usually spreads through close contact between people. Vaccines provide strong protection against severe illness and death, although vaccinated people may still get infected and have mild or no symptoms. Anyone can get sick, but most people recover without treatment. Older adults (60+) and people with medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, immunosuppression (including HIV), cancer, or pregnancy are at higher risk. Unvaccinated individuals also face greater risk.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSymptoms generally begin 5–6 days after exposure and last 1–14 days.\n\n**Most common symptoms:**\n- Fever\n- Chills\n- Sore throat\n\n**Less common symptoms:**\n- Muscle aches or heavy limbs\n- Severe fatigue\n- Runny or blocked nose, sneezing\n- Headache\n- Sore eyes\n- Dizziness\n- New persistent cough\n- Chest tightness or pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- Hoarse voice\n- Numbness or tingling\n- Appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea\n- Loss or change of taste or smell\n- Sleep difficulties\n\n**Seek immediate medical attention if experiencing:**\n- Difficulty breathing at rest\n- Inability to speak full sentences\n- Confusion or drowsiness\n- Chest pain or pressure\n- Skin turning pale, cold, or bluish\n- Loss of speech or movement\n\nPeople with chronic health conditions such as heart, lung, liver, rheumatological diseases, HIV, diabetes, cancer, obesity or dementia are at higher risk and should seek help early if symptoms worsen.\n\nSevere COVID-19 may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, blood clots, heart, liver or kidney injury, or death. Rarely, children may develop a severe inflammatory syndrome weeks after infection.\n\nSome people continue to experience symptoms after recovery—this is known as **long COVID** (post COVID-19 condition). Common long COVID symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive difficulties, which may affect daily functioning.\n\n**Treatment:**\nMost people recover without hospitalization. Treatment depends on symptom severity, age, and underlying health conditions. Those with severe disease or high-risk factors require early medical care.\n\n**Prevention:**\nVaccination is the most effective tool to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Additional preventive measures include:\n- Avoiding crowded places\n- Maintaining physical distance\n- Wearing masks if sick, at high risk, or in poorly ventilated areas\n- Cleaning hands frequently\n- Covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing\n- Disposing of tissues immediately and washing hands\n- Self-isolating after testing positive or developing symptoms\n\nVaccination priority groups include people aged 60+, those with underlying medical conditions, immunosuppression (including HIV), obesity, cancer, pregnant individuals, and unvaccinated people. WHO's recommendations for primary series and booster doses may change as the virus evolves.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO leads global coordination of the COVID-19 response, including research, guidance development, vaccine distribution, and monitoring global case trends. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, launched in April 2020, enabled rapid development of diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine tools. COVAX, part of ACT-Accelerator, works to ensure equitable global access to vaccines.\n\nWHO also coordinates vaccine safety monitoring, provides technical support, and develops target product profiles for COVID-19 vaccines. It supports countries in oxygen production and supply enhancement. Although the emergency phase ended in May 2023, WHO continues to coordinate ongoing global response efforts.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["COVID-19","coronavirus","SARS-CoV-2","pandemic","vaccination","public health","WHO","respiratory disease","infection prevention","long COVID"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_053","title":"Influenza","body":"**Key Points:**\nFlu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can range from mild to severe illness. Most experts believe flu spreads mainly through tiny droplets produced when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. The first and most important step to prevent flu is getting a flu vaccine every year.\n\n**Understanding Influenza:**\nFlu is caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness and can lead to death. The best prevention is annual vaccination.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nFlu symptoms usually appear suddenly and can be mild to severe. Common symptoms include:\n- Fever or chills\n- Cough\n- Sore throat\n- Runny or stuffy nose\n- Muscle or body aches\n- Headaches\n- Fatigue\n- Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children)\nNot everyone with flu will have a fever. Some people do not show any symptoms at all; a study from 2017–2023 found that 8% of people with flu infections were asymptomatic.\n\n**Period of Contagiousness:**\n- People with flu are most contagious during the first three days of illness.\n- Healthy adults may spread flu from 1 day before symptoms to 5–7 days after becoming sick.\n- Children and immunocompromised individuals may be contagious for longer.\n\n**Onset of Symptoms:**\nSymptoms typically appear about 2 days after infection but can range from 1–4 days.\n\n**People at Risk:**\nAnyone can get flu, but certain groups are at higher risk for complications:\n- Adults 65+ years\n- People with chronic medical conditions (asthma, diabetes, heart disease)\n- People with BMI ≥ 40\n- Pregnant individuals\n- Children under 5 years\n\n**How It Spreads:**\nFlu viruses spread mainly through droplets when infected people cough, sneeze, or talk. Less commonly, a person may catch the flu by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\n**Prevention:**\nThe most important preventive measure is yearly flu vaccination. The vaccine reduces flu-related illness and the risk of severe complications such as hospitalization or death. Other prevention steps include:\n- Staying away from sick people\n- Covering coughs and sneezes\n- Washing hands frequently\n- Improving ventilation and air cleanliness\n\n**Quick Facts:**\n**U.S. Annual Flu Infection Rates:** A 2018 CDC study found that about 8% of the U.S. population gets sick with flu each season, ranging from 3% to 11% depending on the season.\n\n**Groups Most Likely to Get Sick:**\n- Children (0–17 years): 9.3% attack rate\n- Adults (18–64 years): 8.8% attack rate\n- Adults 65+: 3.9% attack rate\nChildren are more than twice as likely to develop symptomatic flu compared to older adults.\n\n**Estimating Seasonal Flu Incidence:**\nFlu infections are estimated based on hospitalization rates and adjusted to reflect total infections, since many people do not seek medical care or testing.\n\n**Impact of Flu Season Severity:**\nThe percentage of people who get flu varies by season—from 3% in low-severity seasons to 11% in moderate or high-severity seasons.\n\n**Table – Estimates of Symptomatic Influenza (2010–2022):**\nA detailed table (2010–2022) shows incidence rates by age and predominant virus strains, with variations based on season severity.\n\n**Complications of Flu:**\nFlu can lead to:\n- Bacterial pneumonia\n- Ear and sinus infections\n- Worsening chronic medical conditions (heart failure, asthma, diabetes)\n\n**Testing and Diagnosis:**\nFlu cannot be diagnosed by symptoms alone; diagnostic tests are available.\n\n**Treatment:**\nAntiviral medications can treat flu illness. Early treatment reduces complications.\n\n**Types of Flu Viruses:**\nFlu A and B viruses cause seasonal flu epidemics. Flu A viruses have subtypes based on surface proteins.\n\n**How Flu Viruses Change:**\nFlu viruses evolve through antigenic drift and antigenic shift.\n\n**Transmission from Animals to Humans:**\nFlu A viruses infect many animals (birds, pigs, dogs, horses, whales). Some strains can infect humans.\n\n**Avian, Canine, Swine Flu:**\nInformation is available on flu viruses in birds, dogs, and pigs, along with human infections from animal-origin flu viruses.\n\n**Pandemic Flu:**\nA flu pandemic occurs when a new flu A virus spreads globally.\n\n**Human Serology and Flu:**\nCDC conducts serology studies to improve vaccines and pandemic preparedness.\n\n**Antigenic Characterization:**\nCDC analyzes circulating flu viruses each year to guide vaccine composition.\n\n**Flu Virus Genome Sequencing:**\nCDC researches genetic changes in flu viruses to support public health goals.\n\n**Expanding Genomic Sequencing:**\nCDC helps U.S. state labs expand flu sequencing capacity through funding and training.\n\n**Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD):**\nCDC uses advanced technology to study flu viruses in greater detail than previously possible.","category":"Respiratory Diseases","tags":["influenza","flu","respiratory illness","flu vaccine","CDC","viral infection","public health","prevention","flu complications","transmission"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/index.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_054","title":"Tuberculosis","body":"**Key Facts:**\nA total of 1.23 million people died from tuberculosis (TB) in 2024 (including 150 000 among people with HIV). TB remains the world’s leading cause of death from a single infectious agent and one of the top 10 causes of death. It was the leading killer of people with HIV in 2024 and a major contributor to antimicrobial resistance–related deaths. In 2024, an estimated 10.7 million people fell ill with TB worldwide (5.8 million men, 3.7 million women, 1.2 million children). TB occurs in all countries and age groups. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a major global health threat, with only 2 in 5 drug-resistant TB patients receiving treatment in 2024. Global TB efforts have saved an estimated 83 million lives since 2000. TB is preventable and curable.\n\n**Overview:**\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious bacterial disease that primarily affects the lungs. It spreads through the air when infected individuals cough, sneeze or spit. About a quarter of the global population is infected with TB bacteria, though most do not feel sick or spread the disease. Only 5–10% of infected individuals develop TB disease. Babies and children are at higher risk. TB is treatable with antibiotics, but fatal without treatment. In many countries, the BCG vaccine is administered to babies to prevent severe TB forms. Risk factors for TB disease include diabetes, weakened immunity (e.g., HIV), undernutrition, tobacco use, and harmful alcohol use.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMost people with TB infection do not feel sick or spread TB. TB disease develops when bacteria multiply and affect organs, usually the lungs, but also the kidneys, brain and spine. TB symptoms may be mild for months, increasing the risk of unknowingly spreading infection. Some people with TB disease have no symptoms but can still spread TB.\n\n**Common TB symptoms include:**\n- Prolonged cough (sometimes with blood)\n- Chest pain\n- Weakness\n- Fatigue\n- Weight loss\n- Fever\n- Night sweats\n\nSymptoms vary depending on the affected organ.\n\n**Prevention:**\nPrevention strategies include:\n- Seeking medical attention early for prolonged cough, fever, or unexplained weight loss\n- Screening for TB if at higher risk (e.g., HIV, household exposure)\n- Completing TB preventive treatment (TPT) if prescribed\n- Practicing good cough hygiene when infected (masking, covering mouth/nose, proper disposal of tissues)\n- Ensuring good ventilation and respirator use in healthcare and institutional settings\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nWHO recommends rapid diagnostic tests as the initial method for all people with TB symptoms. These include biomarker-based tests and molecular assays that provide results within 48 hours. Diagnosing drug-resistant TB, HIV-associated TB, and pediatric TB can be complex; WHO provides specific recommendations for accurate detection.\n\nTests used to detect TB infection include the tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assays (IGRA), and newer antigen-based skin tests (TBST). These identify individuals who may benefit from TB preventive treatment.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTB disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease. Common antibiotics include:\n- Rifampicin\n- Isoniazid\n- Pyrazinamide\n- Ethambutol\n\nTreatment lasts 4–6 months and must be taken consistently. Stopping early can cause drug resistance. Drug-resistant TB requires alternative medications.\n\n**Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB):**\nMDR-TB occurs when TB bacteria do not respond to rifampicin and isoniazid. MDR-TB can be treated with other, often more expensive medicines that may have more side effects. People exposed to MDR-TB may receive levofloxacin as preventive treatment.\n\nXDR-TB (extensively drug-resistant TB) can develop when MDR-TB bacteria become resistant to additional drugs, leaving limited treatment options. MDR-TB remains a global crisis, with only 40% of patients receiving treatment in 2024.\n\nWHO prioritizes a 6-month all-oral short regimen (BPaLM/BPaL) for eligible patients. Global scale-up increased from 1,744 people on short regimens in 2022 to 34,000 in 2024.\n\n**TB and HIV:**\nPeople living with HIV are 12 times more likely to develop TB disease. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV. In 2024, 150,000 people died from HIV-associated TB. About 82% of individuals with TB had documented HIV test results in 2024. The African Region bears the highest HIV-associated TB burden.\n\nOnly 61% of people with HIV-associated TB received antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2024. Joint TB/HIV activities recommended by WHO since 2004 have helped avert 9.8 million deaths through screening, prevention and treatment.\n\n**Impact:**\nTB affects people of all ages but mainly adults in their productive years. Over 80% of TB cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. In 2024, new TB cases were highest in the WHO South-East Asia Region (34%), Western Pacific Region (27%), and African Region (25%). Eight countries accounted for two-thirds of global TB cases, with India alone representing 25%.\n\nAbout 50% of TB patients and families face catastrophic costs (>20% of total household income). TB risk increases with HIV, undernutrition, diabetes, tobacco use and alcohol use. In 2024, new TB cases attributable to key risk factors included 0.97 million (undernutrition), 0.93 million (diabetes), 0.74 million (alcohol use), 0.70 million (smoking), and 0.57 million (HIV).\n\n**Investments to End TB:**\nUS$ 22 billion is needed annually by 2027 to reach global TB targets. In 2024, 82% of TB funding came from domestic sources, totaling US$ 4.8 billion in LMICs. Brazil, China, India, the Russian Federation, and South Africa contributed 64% of domestic spending. Donor funding remained at US$ 1.1 billion. TB research funding in 2023 was US$ 1.2 billion—far below the target of US$ 5 billion per year.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO works with countries, partners, and civil society to scale up the TB response. Its six core functions support global TB targets, the 2023 UN High-Level Meeting declaration, the End TB Strategy, SDGs, and WHO strategic priorities.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["tuberculosis","TB","MDR-TB","XDR-TB","infectious disease","public health","HIV-associated TB","TB treatment","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_055","title":"HIV and AIDS","body":"**Key Facts:**\nHIV remains a major global public health issue, responsible for an estimated 44.1 million deaths to date. Transmission continues in all countries. By the end of 2024, approximately 40.8 million people were living with HIV, 65% of whom were in the WHO African Region. In 2024, there were an estimated 630,000 HIV-related deaths and 1.3 million new HIV infections. While there is no cure, effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care—including for opportunistic infections—allow people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. WHO, UNAIDS and the Global Fund have aligned strategies toward ending the HIV epidemic by 2030. The 95-95-95 targets aim for 95% of all people with HIV diagnosed, 95% of them on treatment, and 95% of those on treatment achieving viral suppression. In 2024, progress stood at 87%, 89% and 94% respectively. Among all people living with HIV globally, 87% knew their status, 77% were on ART, and 73% had suppressed viral loads.\n\n**Overview:**\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system by targeting white blood cells. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. HIV spreads through body fluids including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids, and can also be transmitted from mother to child. It is not spread by casual contact such as kisses, hugs or sharing food. ART can prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. WHO defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as a CD4 cell count below 200 cells/mm³ or WHO stage 3 or 4 in adults and adolescents; all children aged under 5 with HIV are considered to have AHD.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms:**\nHIV symptoms vary by stage of infection. Many people have no symptoms during early infection, though some develop flu-like symptoms such as:\n- Fever\n- Headache\n- Rash\n- Sore throat\n\nAs HIV progresses, the immune system weakens, causing symptoms such as:\n- Swollen lymph nodes\n- Weight loss\n- Fever\n- Diarrhoea\n- Cough\n\nWithout treatment, people can develop severe illnesses including:\n- Tuberculosis (TB)\n- Cryptococcal meningitis\n- Severe bacterial infections\n- Cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi’s sarcoma\n\nHIV can also worsen infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and mpox.\n\n**Transmission:**\nHIV is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids such as blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal secretions. It can be transmitted during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. HIV is *not* spread through casual contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands or sharing food, water or objects.\n\nPeople living with HIV who take ART and maintain an undetectable viral load **will not transmit HIV** to sexual partners (U=U). Early diagnosis and consistent treatment are therefore key to preventing transmission.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\nBehaviours and conditions increasing HIV risk include:\n- Anal or vaginal sex without a condom\n- Having another STI (syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, bacterial vaginosis)\n- Alcohol or drug use during sex\n- Sharing needles, syringes or injecting equipment\n- Unsafe injections, blood transfusions or tissue transplantation\n- Unsterile medical procedures or accidental needle stick injuries\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nHIV is diagnosed using rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results, facilitating early diagnosis and treatment. HIV self-tests are also available. However, a diagnosis must always be confirmed by a trained health worker using a validated testing strategy. Most tests detect antibodies produced within 28 days of infection, during which false negatives may occur (the “window period”). People with recent high-risk exposure who test negative should be retested after 28 days.\n\nFollowing a positive test, retesting is required before starting treatment to rule out error. Diagnosis in infants under 18 months requires virological testing, not antibody testing. New point-of-care technologies allow same-day results for early infant diagnosis.\n\n**Prevention:**\nHIV is preventable. Prevention strategies include:\n- Using male or female condoms during sex\n- Testing for HIV and STIs\n- Male circumcision\n- Harm reduction services for people who inject drugs\n\n**WHO-recommended PrEP options include:**\n- Oral tenofovir (TDF)-based PrEP\n- Dapivirine vaginal ring\n- Long-acting injectable cabotegravir\n- Long-acting injectable lenacapavir\n\nART also prevents mother-to-child transmission when taken during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding.\n\n**PrEP and PEP:**\n- **Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP):** Taken before exposure to prevent infection\n- **Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP):** Taken after potential exposure\nPeople should seek clinical advice when considering PrEP or PEP.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere is no cure for HIV. Treatment involves antiretroviral therapy (ART), which suppresses viral replication, strengthens the immune system and prevents disease progression. ART must be taken daily for life. A person on ART with an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV sexually.\n\nPregnant women should start ART immediately to protect themselves and prevent transmission to their babies. Advanced HIV disease remains a major challenge; WHO is supporting the rollout of comprehensive care packages and new treatments such as shorter regimens for opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis. Long-acting injectable medicines, including lenacapavir, may further improve prevention and treatment options.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe WHO Global Health Sector Strategies (GHSSs) for 2022–2030 guide global actions to end AIDS, viral hepatitis and STIs by 2030. WHO’s HIV, Hepatitis and STIs Programmes support countries with evidence-based guidance, innovation, and technical assistance, focusing on reaching the populations most affected and reducing inequities. Under the principles of universal health coverage and primary health care, WHO works to achieve the goals of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["HIV","AIDS","antiretroviral therapy","PrEP","PEP","viral suppression","public health","HIV prevention","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_056","title":"Hepatitis B","body":"**Key Facts:**\nHepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is most commonly transmitted from mother to child during birth or early childhood, and through contact with infected blood or body fluids (such as during sex, unsafe injections, or exposure to sharp instruments). In 2022, an estimated 254 million people were living with chronic hepatitis B, with 1.2 million new infections each year. Hepatitis B caused approximately 1.1 million deaths in 2022, mainly from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Vaccines are safe, widely available, and highly effective in preventing hepatitis B.\n\n**Overview:**\nHepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and can lead to acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) infection. Chronic infection significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. HBV spreads through infected blood, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids, and from mother to child. A safe and effective vaccine provides nearly 100% protection when administered shortly after birth, followed by booster doses. The global burden is highest in the Western Pacific Region (97 million chronically infected) and African Region (65 million). High burdens also exist in South-East Asia (61 million), Eastern Mediterranean (15 million), European Region (11 million), and the Americas (5 million).\n\n**Transmission:**\nIn highly endemic regions, HBV is most frequently transmitted from mother to child at birth or between young children during the first five years of life. Chronic infection develops in about 95% of infants infected early in life, compared to less than 5% of adults infected later. HBV can also spread through needlestick injuries, tattooing, piercing, or contact with infected blood and body fluids. Sharing contaminated needles or syringes, and unsterile medical or cosmetic procedures, increase the risk. Sexual transmission is more common among unvaccinated individuals with multiple partners.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMost newly infected individuals show no symptoms. Some may develop acute illness lasting several weeks, including:\n- Jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes)\n- Dark urine\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Abdominal pain\n\nSevere acute hepatitis can lead to liver failure and death. While many recover fully, some with chronic infection develop liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), which can be fatal.\n\n**HBV–HIV Coinfection:**\nAbout 1% (2.7 million) of people living with HBV are also infected with HIV. Conversely, 7.4% of people with HIV have HBV infection. WHO recommends HIV treatment for all diagnosed individuals. The drug **tenofovir**, used in first-line HIV therapy, is also effective against HBV.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nHepatitis B cannot be diagnosed clinically and requires laboratory testing. Blood tests detect viral markers and distinguish between acute and chronic infection. Additional tests such as ultrasound and elastography evaluate liver fibrosis and disease progression. WHO recommends screening all blood donations for HBV.\n\nIn 2022, only 13% of people living with HBV were aware of their infection, and only 3% (7 million) were receiving treatment. The prevalence of chronic HBV in children under 5 dropped below 1% in 2019 due to widespread vaccination.\n\nWHO recommends adult HBsAg testing in areas with >2% HBV prevalence, with linkage to prevention, care, and treatment services. Targeted testing is advised for high-risk groups, including migrants, partners of infected individuals, health workers, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, men who have sex with men, sex workers, transgender individuals, and people living with HIV.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere is no specific treatment for acute HBV; care focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing dehydration.\n\nChronic hepatitis B can be treated with antiviral medicines such as **tenofovir** and **entecavir**, which:\n- Slow progression to cirrhosis\n- Reduce liver cancer risk\n- Improve long-term survival\n\nMost people receiving treatment require lifelong therapy.\n\nThe 2024 WHO guidelines estimate that over 50% of people with chronic HBV may require treatment, depending on eligibility criteria.\n\nIn low-income countries, liver cancer is often diagnosed late, resulting in high mortality. In high-income countries, earlier diagnosis allows access to surgery, chemotherapy, and liver transplantation.\n\n**Prevention:**\nHepatitis B is preventable through vaccination. All infants should receive the first dose within 24 hours of birth, followed by 2–3 additional doses. Booster doses are generally not required once the series is completed.\n\nThe vaccine protects for at least 20 years, and likely for life.\n\nMother-to-child transmission can be prevented through antiviral treatment during pregnancy and timely vaccination of newborns.\n\nTo reduce HBV transmission:\n- Practice safe sex using condoms\n- Avoid sharing needles or piercing/tattoo equipment\n- Wash hands thoroughly after contact with blood or body fluids\n- Get vaccinated if working in healthcare or other high-risk settings\n\n**WHO Response:**\nGlobal health sector strategies (GHSS) for HIV, viral hepatitis, and STIs (2022–2030) guide health systems toward ending chronic HBV, HCV, HIV, and STIs by 2030. WHO supports countries by updating guidelines, strengthening prevention, testing and treatment programs, and promoting equitable access to care. WHO also raises awareness through annual World Hepatitis Day campaigns and helps nations integrate HBV strategies into broader universal health coverage and primary healthcare frameworks.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["hepatitis B","HBV","liver disease","cirrhosis","hepatocellular carcinoma","vaccination","viral hepatitis","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_057","title":"Hepatitis C","body":"**Key Facts:**\nHepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It can cause both acute and chronic hepatitis, ranging from mild illness to lifelong disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV is a bloodborne virus, commonly transmitted through unsafe injections, unscreened blood transfusions, shared needles among people who inject drugs, and sexual practices that involve blood exposure. Globally, around 50 million people have chronic HCV infection, with 1 million new infections each year. In 2022, approximately 242,000 people died from hepatitis C, mostly from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Direct-acting antiviral medicines (DAAs) can cure more than 95% of patients, but access to diagnosis and treatment remains low. There is currently no effective vaccine for hepatitis C.\n\n**Overview:**\nHepatitis C is a viral liver infection that can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). It spreads through contact with infected blood, including through unsafe medical procedures, unscreened transfusions, shared needles and syringes, and certain sexual practices. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and jaundice. There is no vaccine, but antiviral treatments can cure the infection. Early detection and treatment prevent serious complications.\n\nAcute infections are often asymptomatic and do not usually become life-threatening. About 30% of people clear the virus spontaneously within six months. However, 70% develop chronic infection, and 15–30% of these individuals progress to cirrhosis within 20 years.\n\n**Geographical Distribution:**\nHCV occurs in all WHO regions. The highest burden is in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (12 million). Other regions with high chronic infection include:\n- South-East Asia: 9 million\n- Europe: 9 million\n- Western Pacific: 7 million\n- Africa: 8 million\n- Americas: 5 million\n\nAbout 2.3 million of the estimated 39 million people living with HIV also show past or current HCV infection. Chronic liver disease is a major cause of illness and death among people living with HIV.\n\n**Transmission:**\nHepatitis C is most commonly transmitted through:\n- Reuse or poor sterilization of medical equipment (needles, syringes)\n- Unscreened blood transfusions and blood products\n- Sharing injection equipment among people who inject drugs\n\nLess common transmission routes include mother-to-child transmission and sexual practices with blood exposure (e.g., among people with multiple partners or men who have sex with men). HCV is **not** spread through breast milk, food, water, hugging, kissing, or sharing food/drinks.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nAcute HCV infection is often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they may take 2 weeks to 6 months to appear. Possible symptoms include:\n- Fever\n- Fatigue\n- Loss of appetite\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Abdominal pain\n- Dark urine\n- Pale stools\n- Joint pain\n- Jaundice\n\nChronic infection may remain silent for decades until serious liver damage develops.\n\n**Testing and Diagnosis:**\nMost new HCV infections go undiagnosed because they are asymptomatic. Chronic infections are often diagnosed late, after liver damage is already present.\n\nDiagnosis involves two steps:\n1. **Anti-HCV antibody test** to identify past or present infection.\n2. **Nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA** to confirm chronic infection.\n\nPeople who clear the virus naturally remain antibody-positive but RNA-negative. After diagnosis, liver damage should be assessed via biopsy or non-invasive tests.\n\nWHO recommends testing for people at higher risk, including:\n- Blood donors\n- People with liver disease\n- Migrants from high-prevalence countries\n- Healthcare workers\n- People who inject drugs\n- People in prisons\n- Men who have sex with men (MSM)\n- Sex workers\n- People living with HIV or TB\n\nIn regions with >2% antibody prevalence, WHO recommends population-wide testing for adults and adolescents.\n\n**Treatment:**\nIn 2013–2014, interferon-free treatment became available, revolutionizing HCV care. Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) cure >95% of patients within 8–12 weeks.\n\nWHO recommends pan-genotypic DAAs for all adults, adolescents, and children aged 3 years and older. These medicines have few side effects and are short-course treatments.\n\nThe most widely used, low-cost DAA regimen is **sofosbuvir + daclatasvir**, available in many low- and middle-income countries for under USD 50.\n\nDespite effective treatment, global access remains limited. As of 2022:\n- 36% of people with HCV knew their diagnosis\n- 20% (12.5 million) of diagnosed individuals had been treated\n\nLifestyle changes such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight support liver health.\n\n**Service Delivery:**\nHistorically, HCV care depended on specialists in hospital settings. Today, simplified DAA treatment allows testing, diagnosis, and treatment in primary care, harm reduction services, and prisons. WHO recommends decentralization, integration, and task-shifting to increase access.\n\n**Prevention:**\nThere is no effective vaccine for hepatitis C. Prevention focuses on avoiding exposure to infected blood.\n\nPrevention strategies include:\n- Safe and sterile healthcare injections and procedures\n- Proper handling of medical waste\n- Harm-reduction programs for people who inject drugs (needle exchange, counseling, OAT)\n- Screening donated blood\n- Practicing safe sex using condoms\n\nPeople at higher risk include individuals who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, people living with HIV, and individuals undergoing repeated medical procedures.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe WHO Global Health Sector Strategies (2022–2030) guide countries in ending chronic hepatitis B and C, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections by 2030. They emphasize scaling up prevention, testing, and treatment; addressing inequities; and integrating services within universal health coverage. WHO updates guidelines and works with countries to implement best practices.\n\nWHO also collaborates with UNITAID in expanding access to HCV prevention, testing, and treatment in 10 focus countries, especially among people who inject drugs and people in prisons. WHO leads World Hepatitis Day campaigns to raise awareness and promote prevention.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["hepatitis C","HCV","direct-acting antivirals","cirrhosis","liver cancer","bloodborne virus","viral hepatitis","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-c","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_058","title":"Dengue","body":"**Key Facts:**\nDengue is a viral infection caused by the dengue virus (DENV), transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. About half of the world’s population is now at risk, with 100–400 million infections each year. Dengue is common in tropical and sub-tropical climates, especially urban and semi-urban areas. Most infections are mild or asymptomatic, but severe dengue can cause death. Prevention relies on mosquito (vector) control, and there is no specific treatment for dengue or severe dengue. Early detection and access to proper care greatly reduce fatality rates.\n\n**Overview:**\nDengue (also known as break-bone fever) is a mosquito-borne viral infection. It is more common in tropical and subtropical regions. Many infected individuals show no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they often include high fever, headache, body pains, nausea, and rash. Most people recover within 1–2 weeks, but some develop severe dengue requiring hospitalization. Severe cases can be fatal. Risk can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites, especially during daytime when dengue vectors are most active. Treatment focuses on pain management; no specific antiviral treatment exists.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMost people experience mild or no symptoms and recover in 1–2 weeks. When symptoms occur, they usually start 4–10 days after infection and last 2–7 days.\n\n**Common symptoms include:**\n- High fever (40°C/104°F)\n- Severe headache\n- Pain behind the eyes\n- Muscle and joint pain\n- Nausea\n- Vomiting\n- Swollen glands\n- Rash\n\nPeople infected a second time are at higher risk of severe dengue. **Severe dengue symptoms** may include:\n- Severe abdominal pain\n- Persistent vomiting\n- Rapid breathing\n- Bleeding gums or nose\n- Fatigue\n- Restlessness\n- Blood in vomit or stool\n- Extreme thirst\n- Pale, cold skin\n- Weakness\n\nPeople with severe symptoms need immediate medical care. After recovery, fatigue may persist for weeks.\n\n**Diagnostics and Treatment:**\nDengue diagnosis relies on laboratory-based or point-of-care tests. Diagnostic methods include:\n- NAATs (nucleic acid amplification tests)\n- ELISAs\n- Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)\n- Antigen detection\n- Molecular detection or virus isolation\n\nTest quality varies widely across countries. There is **no specific treatment** for dengue. Pain can be managed with **paracetamol (acetaminophen)**. **Ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided** because they increase the risk of bleeding. Severe dengue often requires hospitalization.\n\n**Global Burden:**\nDengue incidence has grown dramatically worldwide. WHO-reported cases increased from 505,430 in 2000 to **14.6 million in 2024**, with over 12,000 dengue-related deaths. Most infections are asymptomatic or mild, leading to significant underreporting. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries.\n\nIn 2024, dengue spread globally, affecting all continents. Over 13 million cases were reported in the Region of the Americas. Factors driving increased spread include:\n- Expansion of vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) into new areas\n- Climate change (temperature, rainfall, humidity)\n- Weak health systems\n- Poor surveillance and reporting\n- Political instability and population movement\n\nModels estimate **390 million infections each year**, with 96 million cases clinically apparent. In early 2025, over 4 million cases and 3,000 deaths were reported from 97 countries. Dengue continues to spread into Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\n**Transmission:**\n**Mosquito-to-human transmission:**\nDengue is transmitted primarily through the bite of infected **female Aedes aegypti** mosquitoes. Aedes albopictus can also transmit the virus. After feeding on an infected person, the virus replicates inside the mosquito and becomes transmissible after the **extrinsic incubation period (8–12 days)**.\n\n**Human-to-mosquito transmission:**\nMosquitoes can become infected by biting individuals who are:\n- Symptomatic\n- Pre-symptomatic\n- Asymptomatic\n\nTransmission can occur from **2 days before symptoms** to **2 days after fever resolves**. Higher fever and viral load increase infectiousness.\n\n**Maternal transmission:**\nRare but possible. Infection during pregnancy increases risks of pre-term birth, low birthweight, and fetal distress.\n\n**Other rare modes:**\n- Blood transfusion\n- Organ transplantation\n- Transovarial transmission in mosquitoes\n\n**Risk Factors:**\nRisk increases with:\n- Previous dengue infection (higher risk of severe dengue)\n- Rapid, unplanned urbanization (crowding, water storage)\n- Human mobility\n- Poor community practices in mosquito control\n- Climate change\n- Expansion of mosquito habitats into new regions\n\n**Prevention and Control:**\nAedes mosquitoes are active during the day. Prevention includes:\n\n**Avoid mosquito bites:**\n- Wear long clothing\n- Use mosquito nets (preferably insecticide-treated)\n- Install window screens\n- Use repellents (DEET, Picaridin, IR3535)\n- Use coils and vaporizers\n\n**Prevent mosquito breeding:**\n- Remove standing water\n- Dispose of waste properly\n- Clean and cover water storage containers weekly\n- Apply insecticides to outdoor water containers\n\n**If infected:**\n- Rest\n- Drink plenty of fluids\n- Use paracetamol\n- Avoid NSAIDs\n- Monitor for severe symptoms and seek medical care\n\n**Vaccines:**\nOne vaccine, **QDenga**, is licensed in some countries for ages 6–16 in high-transmission settings. Multiple vaccines are under evaluation.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO responds to dengue by:\n- Supporting outbreak confirmation using global lab networks\n- Providing guidance for outbreak management\n- Strengthening surveillance and reporting systems\n- Training countries on clinical care, diagnostics, and vector control\n- Developing evidence-based policies and strategies\n- Assisting countries in adopting the **Global Vector Control Response (2017–2030)** and **Global Arbovirus Initiative (2022–2025)**\n- Recommending new tools (insecticides, technologies)\n- Collecting official global dengue data\n- Publishing guidance for surveillance, diagnosis, case management, and vector control","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["dengue","vector-borne disease","Aedes aegypti","mosquito-borne virus","severe dengue","arbovirus","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_059","title":"Measles","body":"**Key Facts:**\nMeasles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can lead to severe complications and death. Measles vaccination averted more than 60 million deaths between 2000 and 2023. Even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in 2023, there were an estimated 107,500 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under vaccinated children under the age of 5 years. The proportion of children receiving a first dose of measles vaccine was 83% in 2023, well below the 2019 level of 86%.\n\n**Overview:**\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications, and even death. Measles can affect anyone but is most common in children. Measles infects the respiratory tract and then spreads throughout the body. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash all over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. The vaccine is safe and helps your body fight off the virus.\n\nBefore the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination, major epidemics occurred approximately every two to three years and caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. An estimated 107,500 people died from measles in 2023 – mostly children under the age of five years, despite the availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine. Accelerated immunization activities by countries, WHO, the Measles & Rubella Partnership (formerly the Measles & Rubella Initiative), and other international partners successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths between 2000–2023. Vaccination decreased an estimated measles deaths from 800,062 in 2000 to 107,500 in 2022.\n\n**Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic:**\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to setbacks in surveillance and immunization efforts. The suspension of immunization services and declines in immunization rates and surveillance across the globe left millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles. No country is exempt from measles, and areas with low immunization encourage the virus to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated children at risk. We must regain progress and achieve regional measles elimination targets, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunization programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, so efforts to reach all children with two measles vaccine doses should be accelerated. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and close immunity gaps.\n\n**Signs and Symptoms:**\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10–14 days after exposure to the virus. A prominent rash is the most visible symptom. Early symptoms usually last 4–7 days. They include:\n- Running nose\n- Cough\n- Red and watery eyes\n- Small white spots inside the cheeks\n\nThe rash begins about 7–18 days after exposure, usually on the face and upper neck. It spreads over about 3 days, eventually to the hands and feet. It usually lasts 5–6 days before fading.\n\nMost deaths from measles are from complications related to the disease. Complications can include:\n- Blindness\n- Encephalitis (an infection causing brain swelling and potentially brain damage)\n- Severe diarrhoea and related dehydration\n- Ear infections\n- Severe breathing problems including pneumonia\n\nIf a woman catches measles during pregnancy, this can be dangerous for the mother and can result in her baby being born prematurely with a low birth weight. Complications are most common in children under 5 years and adults over age 30. They are more likely in children who are malnourished, especially those without enough vitamin A or with a weak immune system from HIV or other diseases. Measles itself also weakens the immune system and can make the body \"forget\" how to protect itself against infections, leaving children extremely vulnerable.\n\n**Who is at Risk?:**\nAny non-immune person (not vaccinated or vaccinated but did not develop immunity) can become infected. Unvaccinated young children and pregnant persons are at highest risk of severe measles complications. Measles is still common, particularly in parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The overwhelming majority of measles deaths occur in countries with low per capita incomes or weak health infrastructures that struggle to reach all children with immunization. Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection. Children with malnutrition or other causes of a weak immune system are at highest risk of death from measles.\n\n**Transmission:**\nMeasles is one of the world's most contagious diseases, spread by contact with infected nasal or throat secretions (coughing or sneezing) or breathing the air that was breathed by someone with measles. The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces for up to two hours. For this reason, it is very infectious, and one person infected by measles can infect nine out of 10 of their unvaccinated close contacts. It can be transmitted by an infected person from four days prior to the onset of the rash to four days after the rash erupts. Measles outbreaks can result in severe complications and deaths, especially among young, malnourished children. In countries close to measles elimination, cases imported from other countries remain an important source of infection.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere is no specific treatment for measles. Caregiving should focus on relieving symptoms, making the person comfortable and preventing complications. Drinking enough water and treatments for dehydration can replace fluids lost to diarrhoea or vomiting. Eating a healthy diet is also important. Doctors may use antibiotics to treat pneumonia and ear and eye infections. All children or adults with measles should receive two doses of vitamin A supplements, given 24 hours apart. This restores low vitamin A levels that occur even in well-nourished children. It can help prevent eye damage and blindness. Vitamin A supplements may also reduce the number of measles deaths.\n\n**Prevention:**\nCommunity-wide vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. All children should be vaccinated against measles. The vaccine is safe, effective and inexpensive. Children should receive two doses of the vaccine to ensure they are immune. The first dose is usually given at 9 months of age in countries where measles is common and 12–15 months in other countries. A second dose should be given later in childhood, usually at 15–18 months. The measles vaccine is given alone or often combined with vaccines for mumps, rubella and/or varicella.\n\nRoutine measles vaccination, combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case rates are crucial for reducing global measles deaths. The measles vaccine has been in use for about 60 years and costs less than US$ 1 per child. The measles vaccine is also used in emergencies to stop outbreaks from spreading. The risk of measles outbreaks is particularly high amongst refugees, who should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Combining vaccines slightly increases the cost but allows for shared delivery and administration costs and importantly, adds the benefit of protection against rubella, the most common vaccine preventable infection that can infect babies in the womb.\n\nIn 2023, 74% of children received both doses of the measles vaccine, and about 83% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday. Two doses of the vaccine are recommended to ensure immunity and prevent outbreaks, as not all children develop immunity from the first dose. Approximately 22 million infants missed at least one dose of measles vaccine through routine immunization in 2023.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nIn 2020, WHO and global stakeholders endorsed the Immunization Agenda 2021–2030. The Agenda aims to achieve the regional targets as a core indicator of impact, positioning measles as a tracer of a health system's ability to deliver essential childhood vaccines. WHO published the Measles and rubella strategic framework in 2020, establishing seven necessary strategic priorities to achieve and sustain the regional measles and rubella elimination goals.\n\nWithout sustained attention, hard-fought gains can easily be lost. Where children are unvaccinated, outbreaks occur. Based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) concluded that measles elimination is under threat, as the disease resurged in numerous countries that achieved, or were close to achieving, elimination. WHO continues to strengthen the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) to ensure timely diagnosis of measles and track the virus' spread to assist countries in coordinating targeted vaccination activities and reduce deaths from this vaccine-preventable disease.\n\nThe Immunization Agenda 2030 Measles & Rubella Partnership (M&RP) is a partnership led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, the Gates Foundation, UNICEF and WHO, to achieve the IA2030 measles and rubella specific targets. Launched in 2001, as the Measles and Rubella Initiative, the revitalized Partnership is committed to ensuring no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome. The Partnership helps countries plan, fund and measure efforts to permanently stop measles and rubella.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["measles","vaccine-preventable disease","airborne disease","viral infection","childhood vaccination","rubella","immunization","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_060","title":"Pneumonia in children","body":"**Key Facts:**\nPneumonia accounts for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old, killing 740,180 children in 2019. Pneumonia can be caused by viruses, bacteria or fungi. Pneumonia can be prevented by immunization, adequate nutrition, and by addressing environmental factors. Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but only one third of children with pneumonia receive the antibiotics they need.\n\n**Overview:**\nPneumonia is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. Pneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumonia killed 740,180 children under the age of 5 in 2019, accounting for 14% of all deaths of children under 5 years old but 22% of all deaths in children aged 1 to 5 years. Pneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but deaths are highest in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Children can be protected from pneumonia, it can be prevented with simple interventions, and it can be treated with low-cost, low-tech medication and care.\n\n**Causes:**\nPneumonia is caused by several infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. The most common are the following:\n- _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children\n- _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) is the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia\n- Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common viral cause of pneumonia\n- In infants infected with HIV, _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ is one of the most common causes of pneumonia, responsible for at least one quarter of all pneumonia deaths in HIV-infected infants\n\n**Transmission:**\nPneumonia can be spread in several ways. The viruses and bacteria that are commonly found in a child's nose or throat can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through blood, especially during and shortly after birth. More research needs to be done on the different pathogens causing pneumonia and the ways they are transmitted, as this is of critical importance for treatment and prevention.\n\n**Presenting Features:**\nThe presenting features of viral and bacterial pneumonia are similar. However, the symptoms of viral pneumonia may be more numerous than the symptoms of bacterial pneumonia. In children under 5 years of age who have cough and/or difficult breathing, with or without fever, pneumonia is diagnosed by the presence of either fast breathing or lower chest wall indrawing where their chest moves in or retracts during inhalation (in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation). Wheezing is more common in viral infections. Very severely ill infants may be unable to feed or drink and may also experience unconsciousness, hypothermia and convulsions.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\nWhile most healthy children can fight the infection with their natural defences, children whose immune systems are compromised are at higher risk of developing pneumonia. A child's immune system may be weakened by malnutrition or undernourishment, especially in infants who are not exclusively breastfed. Pre-existing illnesses, such as symptomatic HIV infections and measles, also increase a child's risk of contracting pneumonia.\n\nThe following environmental factors also increase a child's susceptibility to pneumonia:\n- Indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating with biomass fuels (such as wood or dung)\n- Living in crowded homes\n- Parental smoking\n\n**Treatment:**\nPneumonia should be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotic of choice for first line treatment is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia.\n\n**Prevention:**\nPreventing pneumonia in children is an essential component of a strategy to reduce child mortality. Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia. Adequate nutrition is key to improving children's natural defences, starting with exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In addition to being effective in preventing pneumonia, it also helps to reduce the length of the illness if a child does become ill. Addressing environmental factors such as indoor air pollution (by providing affordable clean indoor stoves, for example) and encouraging good hygiene in crowded homes also reduces the number of children who fall ill with pneumonia. In children infected with HIV, the antibiotic cotrimoxazole is given daily to decrease the risk of contracting pneumonia.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe WHO and UNICEF integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhoea (GAPPD) aims to accelerate pneumonia control with a combination of interventions to protect, prevent and treat pneumonia in children with actions to:\n- **Protect** children from pneumonia, including promoting exclusive breastfeeding and adequate complementary feeding\n- **Prevent** pneumonia with vaccinations, hand washing with soap, reducing household air pollution, HIV prevention and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for HIV-infected and exposed children\n- **Treat** pneumonia focusing on making sure that every sick child has access to the right kind of care – either from a community-based health worker, or in a health facility if the disease is severe – and can get the antibiotics and oxygen they need to get well\n\nSeveral countries including Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia have developed district, state and national plans to intensify actions for the control of pneumonia and diarrhoea. Many more have integrated diarrhoea and pneumonia specific action into their national child health and child survival strategies. Effective diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia is critical to improve child survival. To meet the Sustainable Development Goal targets for SDG 3.2.1 (reducing child mortality), ending preventable diarrhoea- and pneumonia-related deaths is an urgent priority.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["pneumonia","respiratory infection","childhood pneumonia","Streptococcus pneumoniae","Hib","respiratory syncytial virus","pediatric health","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_061","title":"Diarrhoeal disease","body":"**Key Facts:**\nDiarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children 1–59 months of age. It is both preventable and treatable. Each year diarrhoea kills around 443,832 children under 5 and an additional 50,851 children aged 5 to 9 years. A significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene. Globally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease every year. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old.\n\n**Overview:**\nDiarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years old and is responsible for killing around 443,832 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea-associated deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity, as well as people living with HIV, are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea.\n\nDiarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, pasty stools by breastfed babies. Diarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.\n\nInterventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt. In addition, a 10–14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes.\n\nThere are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea:\n- Acute watery diarrhoea – lasts several hours or days and includes cholera\n- Acute bloody diarrhoea – also called dysentery\n- Persistent diarrhoea – lasts 14 days or longer\n\n**Scope of Diarrhoeal Disease:**\nDiarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity in the world, and mostly results from contaminated food and water sources. Worldwide, 780 million individuals lack access to improved drinking-water and 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation. Diarrhoea due to infection is widespread throughout developing countries. In low-income countries, children under 3 years old experience on average three episodes of diarrhoea every year. Each episode deprives the child of the nutrition necessary for growth. As a result, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, and malnourished children are more likely to fall ill from diarrhoea.\n\n**Dehydration:**\nThe most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During a diarrhoeal episode, water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate) are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not replaced.\n\nThe degree of dehydration is rated on a scale of 3:\n\n**Severe dehydration** (at least two of the following signs):\n- Lethargy/unconsciousness\n- Sunken eyes\n- Unable to drink or drink poorly\n- Skin pinch goes back very slowly (≥2 seconds)\n\n**Some dehydration** (two or more of the following signs):\n- Restlessness, irritability\n- Sunken eyes\n- Drinks eagerly, thirsty\n\n**No dehydration** (not enough signs to classify as some or severe dehydration)\n\n**Causes:**\n**Infection:** Diarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is more common when there is a shortage of adequate sanitation and hygiene and safe water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Among children under 5 years of age, the most common viral pathogens are rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus. Bacterial pathogens include _Escherichia coli_, _Salmonella spp._, _Shigella spp._, and _Campylobacter spp._, while parasitic pathogens include _Cryptosporidium_, _Giardia_, and _Entamoeba spp._ Rotavirus and _E. coli_ are the most common pathogens among children across all age groups, while parasitic pathogens are prevalent in children aged 3–5 years. Bacterial pathogens, including _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, and _Shigella_, were common in the children age 6 to 10-year age group, as were rotavirus, norovirus, and sapovirus. Location-specific etiologic patterns also need to be considered.\n\n**Malnutrition:** Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old.\n\n**Source:** Water contaminated with human faeces, for example from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.\n\n**Other causes:** Diarrhoeal disease can also spread from person-to-person, aggravated by poor personal hygiene. Food is another major cause of diarrhoea when it is prepared or stored in unhygienic conditions. Unsafe domestic water storage and handling is also an important risk factor. Fish and seafood from polluted water may also contribute to the disease.\n\n**Prevention and Treatment:**\n**Key measures to prevent diarrhoea include:**\n- Access to safe drinking-water\n- Use of improved sanitation\n- Hand washing with soap\n- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life\n- Good personal and food hygiene\n- Health education about how infections spread\n- Rotavirus vaccination\n\n**Key measures to treat diarrhoea include:**\n- **Rehydration with oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution.** ORS is a mixture of clean water, salt and sugar. It costs a few cents per treatment. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine and replaces the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces.\n- **Zinc supplements** reduce the duration of a diarrhoea episode by 25% and are associated with a 30% reduction in stool volume.\n- **Rehydration with intravenous fluids** in case of severe dehydration or shock.\n- **Nutrient-rich foods.** The vicious circle of malnutrition and diarrhoea can be broken by continuing to give nutrient-rich foods – including breast milk – during an episode, and by giving a nutritious diet – including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life – to children when they are well.\n- **Consulting a health professional**, in particular for management of persistent diarrhoea or when there is blood in stool or if there are signs of dehydration.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO works with Member States and other partners to:\n- Promote national policies and investments that support case management of diarrhoea and its complications as well as increasing access to safe drinking-water and sanitation in developing countries\n- Conduct research to develop and test new diarrhoea prevention and control strategies in this area\n- Build capacity in implementing preventive interventions, including sanitation, source water improvements, and household water treatment and safe storage\n- Develop new health interventions, such as the rotavirus immunization\n- Help to train health workers, especially at community level","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["diarrhoeal disease","diarrhoea","oral rehydration solution","ORS","rotavirus","dehydration","water sanitation","childhood mortality","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/diarrhoeal-disease","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_062","title":"Cholera","body":"**Key Facts:**\nCholera is a severe diarrheal disease that can be fatal within hours if not treated. Quick access to treatment is crucial. Researchers estimate that there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases and 21,000 to 143,000 deaths from cholera worldwide each year. Most people with cholera have no or mild symptoms and can be treated with oral rehydration solution. Severe cases need intravenous fluids, oral rehydration solution and antibiotics. Population's access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is essential to prevent cholera. The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) can help prevent and control cholera.\n\n**Overview:**\nCholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases. Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics. Countries need strong epidemiological and laboratory surveillance to swiftly detect and monitor outbreaks and guide responses.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCholera can cause severe acute watery diarrhoea, which can be fatal within hours if untreated. Most people infected with _V. cholerae_ do not develop symptoms but can spread the bacteria through their faeces for 1–10 days. Symptoms appear 12 hours to 5 days after infection. Most people with the disease have mild or moderate symptoms. A minority of patients develop severe acute watery diarrhoea and life-threatening dehydration.\n\n**History:**\nCholera has been known for many centuries. The first pandemic, or global epidemic, was recorded in the 19th century. Since then, six pandemics have killed millions of people worldwide. The current (seventh) pandemic started in south Asia in 1961 and continues to affect populations globally.\n\n**Vibrio cholerae Strains:**\nOnly two serogroups, O1 and O139, cause cholera outbreaks. _V. cholerae_ O1 has caused all recent outbreaks. _V. cholerae_ O139 caused outbreaks in Asia in the past but has recently only been identified in sporadic cases. There is no difference in the illness caused by the two serogroups.\n\n**Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Disease Burden:**\nCholera outbreaks occur regularly in some countries. In others, they are less frequent, and it may be years between outbreaks. Cholera is linked to limited access to safe water, basic sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices. This may be due to conflict, population displacement, climate events like cyclones, floods or drought, and lack of investment in maintaining and improving WASH services and infrastructure. The number of cholera cases reported to WHO has continued to rise in recent years. In 2023, 535,321 cases and 4,007 deaths were reported to WHO from 45 countries. The discrepancy between these figures and the numbers estimated by researchers is likely due to limited surveillance systems and cases not being recorded out of fear of repercussions for trade and tourism.\n\n**Prevention and Control:**\nPreventing and controlling cholera involves a combination of strengthening surveillance, improving water, sanitation and hygiene, increasing risk communication and community engagement, improving access to quality treatment and implementing oral cholera vaccine campaigns.\n\n**Surveillance:**\nCholera surveillance should be part of an integrated disease surveillance system. This includes timely reporting, data analysis, interpretation and sharing of information from local to global levels. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are useful for early detection of probable cholera outbreaks, but confirmation requires laboratory testing by culture, seroagglutination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Countries at risk or affected by cholera should strengthen their surveillance systems according to the revised Global Taskforce on Cholera Control (GTFCC) recommendations to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks.\n\n**WASH Interventions:**\nThe long-term solution for cholera control lies in economic development and universal access to safe drinking water, basic sanitation and good hygiene practices. WASH interventions help prevent many waterborne illnesses, including cholera, and contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. During outbreaks, implementing WASH activities can reduce cholera transmission. These activities include improving WASH in healthcare facilities, conducting water quality monitoring, distributing WASH kits to communities and promoting protective hygiene practices.\n\n**Treatment:**\nCholera is an easily treatable disease. Most people can be treated successfully with prompt ORS administration. Severely dehydrated patients are at risk of dying from dehydration and need rapid intravenous fluids. They also receive oral rehydration solution and antibiotics. Patients with underlying conditions or comorbidities may require additional care in specific treatment centres. The case fatality rate in treatment centres should remain below 1%. Community access to ORS is essential during a cholera outbreak. Mass administration of antibiotics to prevent cholera (chemoprophylaxis) is not recommended, as it has no proven effect on the spread of cholera and may contribute to antimicrobial resistance.\n\n**Community Engagement:**\nCommunity engagement involves collaborating with people and communities to develop and implement programmes designed to address their needs. Local culture, practices and beliefs are central to promoting protective practices, such as handwashing with soap and water, safe preparation and storage of food and water, and safe disposal of faeces. Funeral practices for individuals who die from cholera may need to be adapted to prevent infection among attendees. Communities should be involved in deciding the location of oral rehydration points (ORPs) and other community cholera control interventions. Community engagement is essential for effectively communicating the potential risks and symptoms of cholera, precautions to take to avoid cholera, when and where to report cases, and the importance of seeking immediate treatment if symptoms appear.\n\n**Oral Cholera Vaccines:**\nCurrently, three WHO pre-qualified oral cholera vaccines (OCV) are available: Dukoral®, Euvichol-Plus®, and Euvichol-S®. All require two doses to fully protect an adult. One dose of Euvichol-Plus® or Euvichol-S® provides good short-term protection. Euvichol-S®, pre-qualified by WHO in 2024, is a simplified version of Euvichol-Plus®. The Shancol vaccine is no longer produced. Euvichol-Plus® and Euvichol-S® do not require a buffer solution and can be given to anyone over one year old. These are the only vaccines currently available for mass vaccination campaigns through the Global OCV Stockpile, supported by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Since October 2022, due to an ongoing global shortage of vaccines, and with the acceptance of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), only one-dose vaccine regimens are being used. OCV is safe during pregnancy.\n\n**Cholera Kits:**\nWHO has developed six cholera kits to support the investigation and confirmation of cholera outbreaks and the treatment of patients:\n- 1 for investigation\n- 1 with supplies for culture confirmation in a laboratory\n- 3 for treatment at the community, peripheral and central levels\n- 1 support kit with logistical materials, including solar lamps, fencing, water bladders and taps\n\nEach treatment kit provides enough materials to treat 100 patients.\n\n**Global Task Force on Cholera Control:**\nThe Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) is a partnership of governmental and nongovernmental organizations, UN agencies and academic institutions with a common mission to reduce the global cholera burden. The GTFCC Secretariat is hosted by WHO. GTFCC partners work to:\n- Develop global strategies for cholera prevention and control\n- Support countries in long-term control or elimination of cholera through the development of national cholera plans (NCPs)\n- Develop and disseminate technical guidelines and operational manuals\n- Support a research agenda to evaluate innovative approaches to cholera prevention and control in affected countries\n- Increase the visibility of cholera as an important global public health problem\n\n**Ending Cholera: A Roadmap to 2030:**\nIn 2017, the GTFCC published the _Ending cholera: a global roadmap to 2030_ strategy. It aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% and eliminate cholera in as many as 20 countries by 2030 through:\n1. Early detection and containment of outbreaks through rapid multisectoral response\n2. A focus on cholera priority areas for multisectoral interventions (PAMIs) – the relatively small areas most heavily affected by cholera\n3. An effective coordination mechanism for technical support, advocacy, resource mobilization, and partnership at local and global levels\n\nThe strategy was endorsed at the Seventy-first World Health Assembly in 2018.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe WHO cholera programme works to increase awareness of cholera and advocate for its control globally. At Member State level, WHO supports countries in all pillars of cholera control including strengthening epidemiological surveillance, reinforcing laboratory capacity, improving access to and quality of treatment, implementing appropriate WASH and IPC practices, promoting community engagement in cholera prevention and control and facilitating OCV access and campaign implementation. WHO and partners also support research for the development of innovative strategies to prevent and control cholera. WHO hosts the GTFCC Secretariat and is a member of the International Coordinating Group (ICG) emergency vaccination stockpile coordination mechanism.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["cholera","Vibrio cholerae","diarrheal disease","WASH","oral cholera vaccine","OCV","waterborne disease","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_063","title":"Typhoid","body":"**Key Facts:**\nAs of 2019, an estimated 9 million people get sick from typhoid and 110,000 people die from it every year. Symptoms include prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics although increasing resistance to different types of antibiotics is making treatment more complicated. The typhoid conjugate vaccine is recommended for use in children from 6 months of age and in adults up to 45 years or 65 years (depending on the vaccine). Two typhoid conjugate vaccines have been prequalified by WHO since December 2017 and are being introduced into childhood immunization programmes in typhoid endemic countries.\n\n**Overview:**\nTyphoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium _Salmonella_ Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once _Salmonella_ Typhi bacteria are ingested, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream. Urbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread in communities that lack access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n_Salmonella_ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be confirmed through blood testing.\n\n**Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Disease Burden:**\nImproved living conditions and the introduction of antibiotics resulted in a drastic reduction of typhoid fever morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. However, the disease continues to be a public health problem in many developing areas of the WHO African, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions. As of 2019 estimates, there are 9 million cases of typhoid fever annually, resulting in about 110,000 deaths per year. Typhoid risk is higher in populations that lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation, and children are at highest risk.\n\n**Treatment:**\nTyphoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance is common with likelihood of more complicated and expensive treatment options required in the most affected regions. Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others, through shedding of bacteria in their faeces.\n\nIt is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following:\n- Take prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed\n- Wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and avoid preparing or serving food for other people. This will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else\n- Have their doctor test to ensure that no _Salmonella_ Typhi bacteria remain in their body\n\n**Prevention:**\nTyphoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers and typhoid vaccination are all effective in preventing typhoid fever. Typhoid conjugate vaccine, consisting of the purified Vi antigen linked to a carrier protein, is given as a single injectable dose in children from 6 months of age and in adults up to 45 years or 65 years (depending on the vaccine).\n\nTwo additional vaccines have been used for many years in older children and adults at risk of typhoid, including travellers. These vaccines do not provide long-lasting immunity (requiring repeat or booster doses) and are not approved for children younger than 2 years old:\n- An injectable vaccine based on the purified antigen for people aged 2 years and above\n- A live attenuated oral vaccine in capsule formulation for people aged over 6 years\n\nTwo typhoid conjugate vaccines have been prequalified by WHO since December 2017 and are being introduced into childhood immunization programmes in typhoid endemic countries.\n\nAll travellers to endemic areas are at potential risk of typhoid fever, although the risk is generally low in tourist and business centres where standards of accommodation, sanitation and food hygiene are high. Typhoid fever vaccination should be offered to travellers to destinations where the risk of typhoid fever is high.\n\nThe following recommendations will help ensure safety while travelling:\n- Ensure food is properly cooked and still hot when served\n- Avoid raw milk and products made from raw milk. Drink only pasteurized or boiled milk\n- Avoid ice unless it is made from safe water\n- When the safety of drinking water is questionable, boil it, or if this is not possible, disinfect it with a reliable, slow-release disinfectant agent (usually available at pharmacies)\n- Wash hands thoroughly and frequently using soap, in particular after contact with pets or farm animals, or after having been to the toilet\n- Wash fruits and vegetables carefully, particularly if they are eaten raw. If possible, vegetables and fruits should be peeled\n\n**WHO Response:**\nIn October 2017, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which advises WHO on vaccine use, issued a recommendation for the typhoid conjugate vaccine to be added to routine childhood immunization programmes in typhoid endemic countries. SAGE also called for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccine to be prioritized for countries with the highest burden of typhoid disease or high levels of antibiotic resistance to _Salmonella_ Typhi. Starting in 2019, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance has provided funding to support typhoid conjugate vaccine use in eligible countries. As at March 2023, WHO has prequalified two conjugate vaccines for the prevention of typhoid. Typhoid conjugate vaccine has longer-lasting immunity than the older typhoid vaccines and can be given as a single dose to children from the age of 6 months. In addition to decreasing the disease burden in endemic countries and saving lives, widespread use of the typhoid conjugate vaccine in affected countries is expected to reduce the need for antibiotics for typhoid treatment and slow the increase in antibiotic resistance in _Salmonella_ Typhi.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["typhoid","typhoid fever","Salmonella Typhi","waterborne disease","typhoid conjugate vaccine","foodborne illness","antimicrobial resistance","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/typhoid","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_064","title":"Ebola disease","body":"**Key Facts:**\nEbola disease is a severe, often fatal illness in humans. Three different viruses are known to cause large Ebola disease outbreaks: Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus. The average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks. Early intensive supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival. Approved vaccines and treatments are only available for one of the viruses (Ebola virus) and are under development for the others. Outbreak control relies on a package of interventions including intensive supportive care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, vaccination if relevant, and social mobilization.\n\n**Overview:**\nEbola disease (EBOD) is a rare but severe illness in humans. It is often fatal. Ebola disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Orthoebolavirus_ genus of the _filoviridae_ family. Six species of Orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks:\n- Ebola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD)\n- Sudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD)\n- Bundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD)\n\nEbola disease first occurred in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks: one outbreak was of Sudan virus disease in Nzara in what is now South Sudan, and the other outbreak was of Ebola virus disease in Yambuku, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name. While there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development. Early intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival. Seeking early care can be lifesaving.\n\n**Transmission:**\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the _Pteropodidae_ family are natural hosts of the Orthoebolavirus. The virus can get into the human population when people have close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.\n\nPeople can get infected with the virus from another person by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:\n- The blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease\n- Objects or surfaces that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a person sick with the disease or who has died from the disease\n\nPeople cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus. Health and care workers have frequently been infected while treating patients with Ebola disease. This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced. Burial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of a person who has died can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola disease.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nThe incubation period or interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days. The symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver functions. It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms. Despite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease. Some patients may develop internal and external bleeding, including blood in vomit and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina. Bleeding at the sites where needles have punctured the skin can also occur. The impact on the central nervous system can result in confusion, irritability and aggression.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nIt can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola disease from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, meningitis and other viral haemorrhagic fevers because symptoms at early stage of the disease are similar. Confirmation that the person has an Orthoebolavirus infection is made using the following diagnostic methods:\n- Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay\n- Antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n- Antigen-capture detection tests\n- Virus isolation by cell culture\n\nSamples collected from patients are an extreme biohazard risk; laboratory testing on non-inactivated samples should be conducted under maximum biological containment conditions. All non-inactivated biological specimens should be packaged using the triple packaging system when transported nationally and internationally.\n\n**Treatment:**\nOver the years, WHO and partners have developed guidance and training that outline how to provide the best possible care for patients and increase their chance of survival, whether or not specific treatments are being used. Called optimized supportive care, this covers the relevant tests to administer, how to manage pain, nutrition and co-infections (such as malaria), and other approaches that put the patient on the best path to recovery. For Ebola virus disease, WHO made strong recommendations for treatment with mAb114 (ansuvimabTM) or REGN-EB3 (InmazebTM) that are both monoclonal antibodies. For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD, there are no approved therapeutics, but candidate products are under development and a CORE protocol for clinical trials is available.\n\n**Vaccines:**\n**For Ebola virus disease:**\n- Two vaccines are approved: Ervebo (Merck & Co.) and Zabdeno and Mvabea (Janssen Pharmaceutica). Ervebo vaccine is recommended as part of outbreak response\n- In case of a confirmed Ebola virus disease outbreak, Ervebo vaccines can be accessed through the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision\n- For preventive vaccination of health-care and frontline workers, request of Ervebo vaccines can be made through Gavi Preventive Ebola vaccination\n\n**For other Ebola diseases, such as SVD:**\n- Several candidate vaccines are at different stages of development\n- As part of outbreak response, a CORE protocol to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of vaccine candidates is available\n\n**Prevention and Control:**\nCommunity engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreak. Outbreak control relies on using a range of interventions, such as clinical care, surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, infection prevention and control in health facilities, safe and dignified burials, vaccination (only for Ebola virus disease) and social mobilization.\n\nRaising awareness of risk factors and protective measures that individuals can take is an effective way to reduce human transmission. Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:\n- Reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat\n- Reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission arising from direct or close contact with infected people, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Ebola patients should be avoided. Patients should be isolated in a designated treatment center for early care and to avoid transmission at home\n- Communities should be well informed, both about the disease itself and how to control the outbreak. This is done best when they are involved in the response and there is open discussion\n- Outbreak containment measures include safe and dignified burial of the deceased, identifying people who may have been in contact with someone infected with Ebola disease and monitoring their health for 21 days, separating the healthy from the sick to prevent further spread and providing care to confirmed patients. Maintaining good hygiene and a clean environment are also important\n\n**Controlling Infection in Health-Care Settings:**\nHealth-care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include basic hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials), safe injection practices and safe and dignified burial practices. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola disease should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patients' blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Orthoebolavirus infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.\n\n**Care for Survivors:**\nAll survivors, their partners and families should be shown respect, dignity and compassion. WHO does not recommend isolation of recovered patients whose blood has tested negative for Orthoebolavirus. Survivors might suffer from both clinical and psychological sequelae. WHO encourages affected countries to consider the establishment of care programme to alleviate sequelae, support to community reintegration, counselling and biological testing.\n\nOrthoebolaviruses are known to persist in immune-privileged sites in some people who have recovered. These sites include the testicles, the inside of the eye and the brain. Relapse-symptomatic illness in the absence of re-infection in someone who has recovered from Ebola disease is rare but has been documented. Reasons for this phenomenon are not yet fully understood.\n\nEbola virus transmission via infected semen has been documented up to fifteen months after clinical recovery. To mitigate the risk of this transmission, a semen testing programme should be implemented to:\n- Offer counselling to male survivors and their sexual partners to inform them of the potential risk and support them adhering to safer sex practices (including condom provision and good hand and personal hygiene)\n- Offer monthly semen testing until they have had two consecutive negative test results\n- After two consecutive negative tests, survivors can safely resume normal sexual practices with minimized risk of virus transmission\n\nIn the absence of a semen testing programme, male survivors should follow safer sex practices for 12 months. Orthoebolavirus may persist in the placenta, amniotic fluid and fetus of women infected while pregnant, and in the breast milk of breastfeeding women who are infected with the virus. Survivor care programmes should encompass care for pregnant and breastfeeding women after their recovery.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO works with countries to prevent Ebola outbreaks by maintaining surveillance and supporting at-risk countries to develop preparedness plans. When an outbreak is detected, WHO responds by supporting outbreak response, disease detection, community engagement, contact tracing, vaccination, vaccine and treatment trials, case management, laboratory services, infection control, logistics, and training and assistance with safe and dignified burial practices.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["Ebola disease","Ebola virus","Orthoebolavirus","viral hemorrhagic fever","filovirus","Ebola virus disease","Sudan virus","Bundibugyo virus","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ebola-disease","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_065","title":"Zika virus","body":"**Key Facts:**\nZika virus is primarily transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, which bite mostly during the day. Most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur, they include rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise and headache that last for 2–7 days. No vaccine is yet available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause infants to be born with microcephaly (smaller than normal head size) and other congenital malformations, as well as preterm birth and miscarriage. Zika virus infection is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis in adults and children. In February 2016, WHO declared Zika-related microcephaly a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The causal link between the Zika virus and congenital malformations was confirmed, and the PHEIC declaration was lifted in November 2016. Although cases of Zika virus disease declined globally from 2017 onwards, transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and in some countries in Asia and Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have also been documented.\n\n**Overview:**\nZika virus is a mosquito-borne virus that was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in a Rhesus macaque monkey, followed by evidence of infection and disease in humans in other African countries in the 1950s. From the 1960s to the 1980s, sporadic human infections were detected across Africa and Asia. However, since 2007, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.\n\nDuring outbreaks over the last decade, Zika virus infection was found to be associated with increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. When Zika virus emerged in the Americas, with a large epidemic in Brazil in 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly (smaller than normal head size) was first described. Similar findings were observed in French Polynesia upon retrospective review. From February to November 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus, and the causal link between Zika virus and congenital malformations was confirmed soon thereafter. Outbreaks of Zika virus disease were identified throughout most of the Americas and in other regions with established _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito populations. Infections were also detected in travellers from active transmission areas and sexual transmission was confirmed as an alternate route of Zika virus infection.\n\nCases of Zika virus disease globally declined from 2017 onwards. However, Zika virus transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and in other endemic regions. In addition, the first local mosquito-transmitted Zika virus disease cases were reported in Europe in 2019 and Zika virus outbreak activity has been detected in several countries. To date, a total of 92 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito-transmitted Zika virus infection; however, surveillance remains limited globally.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nMost people infected with Zika virus do not develop symptoms. Among people who do become ill, symptoms typically start 3–14 days after infection. Symptoms are generally mild, including rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise and headache, and usually last for 2–7 days. These symptoms are common to other arboviral and non-arboviral diseases; thus, the diagnosis of Zika virus infection requires laboratory confirmation.\n\n**Complications:**\nZika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of microcephaly and other congenital malformations in the infant, including limb contractures, high muscle tone, eye abnormalities and hearing loss. These clinical features are collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome. The risk of congenital malformations following infection in pregnancy remains unknown; an estimated 5–15% of infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy have evidence of Zika-related complications. Congenital malformations occur following both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Zika infection in pregnancy can also cause complications such as fetal loss, stillbirth and preterm birth. Zika virus infection can also cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis, particularly in adults and older children. Research is ongoing to investigate the risk and effects of Zika virus infection on pregnancy outcomes, strategies for prevention and control, and effects of infection on other neurological disorders in children and adults.\n\n**Transmission:**\nZika virus is primarily transmitted by infected mosquitoes of the _Aedes_ (_Stegomyia_) genus, mainly _Aedes aegypti_ but also _Aedes albopictus_; these species also transmit dengue, chikungunya and urban yellow fever. These mosquitoes are most abundant in tropical and subtropical regions, but their geographic range is expanding. _Aedes_ mosquitoes usually bite during the day and mostly outdoors, although they can also feed indoors. Zika virus is also transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, as well as through sexual contact, laboratory exposure, transfusion of blood and blood products, and possibly through organ transplantation.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nInfection with Zika virus may be suspected based on symptoms of persons living in or visiting areas with Zika virus transmission and/or _Aedes_ mosquito vectors. A diagnosis of Zika virus infection can only be confirmed by laboratory tests of blood or other body fluids to detect viral RNA by RT-PCR testing, or through IgM antibody testing. For IgM antibody testing, positive results must be differentiated from cross-reactive related flaviviruses such as dengue virus, to which the patient may have been exposed or previously vaccinated.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere is no specific treatment available for Zika virus infection or disease. People with symptoms such as rash, fever or joint pain should get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and treat symptoms with antipyretics and/or analgesics. If a specific diagnosis cannot be made and dengue cannot be ruled out, patients should be treated as if they have dengue, according to standardized clinical guidelines. This includes avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs until dengue virus infections are ruled out because of bleeding risk. If symptoms worsen, patients should seek medical care and advice. Pregnant women living in areas with Zika transmission or who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection should seek medical attention for laboratory testing, information, counselling and other clinical care.\n\n**Prevention:**\nNo vaccine is yet available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection. Development of a Zika vaccine remains an active area of research.\n\n**Mosquito Bites:**\nProtection against mosquito bites during the day and early evening is a key measure to prevent Zika virus infection, especially among pregnant women, women of reproductive age and young children. Personal protection measures include wearing clothing (preferably light-coloured) that covers as much of the body as possible; using physical barriers such as window screens and closed doors and windows; and applying insect repellent to skin or clothing that contains DEET, IR3535 or icaridin according to the product label instructions. Young children and pregnant women should sleep under mosquito nets if sleeping during the day or early evening. Travellers and people living in affected areas should take the same basic precautions described above to protect themselves from mosquito bites.\n\n_Aedes_ mosquitoes breed in small collections of water around homes, schools and work sites. It is important to eliminate these mosquito breeding sites, including covering water storage containers, removing standing water in flowerpots, and cleaning up trash and used tires. Community initiatives are essential to support local government and public health programmes to reduce mosquito breeding sites. Health authorities may also advise use of larvicides and insecticides to reduce mosquito populations and disease spread.\n\n**Prevention of Sexual Transmission:**\nFor regions with active transmission of Zika virus, all people with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) should receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus. WHO recommends that sexually active men and women be counselled and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant in order to prevent possible adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes. Women who have had unprotected sex and do not wish to become pregnant due to concerns about Zika virus infection should have ready access to emergency contraceptive services and counselling. Pregnant women should practice safer sex (including correct and consistent use of condoms) or abstain from sexual activity for at least the entire duration of pregnancy.\n\nFor regions with no active transmission of Zika virus, WHO recommends practicing safer sex or abstinence for a period of three months for men and two months for women who are returning from areas of active Zika virus transmission to prevent infection of their sex partners. Sexual partners of pregnant women living in or returning from areas where local transmission of Zika virus occurs should practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity throughout pregnancy.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO supports countries to conduct surveillance and control of arboviruses through the implementation of the Global Arbovirus Initiative, which is aligned with and expands upon recommendations laid out in the Zika Strategic Response Plan. WHO responds to Zika in the following ways:\n- Supporting countries in the confirmation of outbreaks through its collaborating network of laboratories\n- Providing technical support and guidance to countries for the effective management of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks\n- Reviewing the development of new tools, including insecticide products and application technologies\n- Formulating evidence-based strategies, policies, and outbreak management plans\n- Providing technical support and guidance to countries for the effective management of cases and outbreaks\n- Supporting countries to improve their reporting systems\n- Providing training on clinical management, diagnosis and vector control at the regional level with some of its collaborating centres\n- Publishing guidelines and handbooks on epidemiological surveillance, laboratory, clinical case management and vector control for Member States","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["Zika virus","Aedes mosquitoes","mosquito-borne virus","microcephaly","congenital Zika syndrome","Guillain-Barré syndrome","arbovirus","vector-borne disease","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_066","title":"Anxiety disorders","body":"**Key Facts:**\nAnxiety disorders are the world's most common mental disorders, affecting 359 million people in 2021. More women are affected by anxiety disorders than men. Symptoms of anxiety often have onset during childhood or adolescence. There are highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders. Approximately 1 in 4 people with anxiety disorders receive treatment for this condition.\n\n**Overview:**\nEveryone can feel anxious sometimes, but people with anxiety disorders often experience fear and worry that is both intense and excessive. These feelings are typically accompanied by physical tension and other behavioural and cognitive symptoms. They are difficult to control, cause significant distress and can last a long time if untreated. Anxiety disorders interfere with daily activities and can impair a person's family, social and school or working life. An estimated 4.4% of the global population currently experience an anxiety disorder. In 2021, 359 million people in the world had an anxiety disorder, making anxiety disorders the most common of all mental disorders. Although highly effective treatments for anxiety disorders exist, only about 1 in 4 people in need (27.6%) receive any treatment. Barriers to care include lack of awareness that this is a treatable health condition, lack of investment in mental health services, lack of trained health-care providers, and social stigma.\n\n**Symptoms and Patterns:**\nPeople with an anxiety disorder may experience excessive fear or worry about a specific situation (for example, a panic attack or social situation) or, in the case of generalized anxiety disorder, about a broad range of everyday situations. They typically experience these symptoms over an extended period – at least several months. Usually they avoid the situations that make them anxious.\n\nOther symptoms of anxiety disorders may include:\n- Trouble concentrating or making decisions\n- Feeling irritable, tense or restless\n- Experiencing nausea or abdominal distress\n- Having heart palpitations\n- Sweating, trembling or shaking\n- Trouble sleeping\n- Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom\n\nAnxiety disorders increase the risk for depression and substance use disorders as well as the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours.\n\nThere are several different kinds of anxiety disorders, including:\n- Generalized anxiety disorder (persistent and excessive worry about daily activities or events)\n- Panic disorder (panic attacks and fear of continued panic attacks)\n- Social anxiety disorder (high levels of fear and worry about social situations that might make the person feel humiliated, embarrassed or rejected)\n- Agoraphobia (excessive fear, worry and avoidance of situations that might cause a person to panic or feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed)\n- Separation anxiety disorder (excessive fear or worry about being separated from people with whom the person has a deep emotional bond)\n- Specific phobias (intense, irrational fears of specific objects or situations that lead to avoidance behaviour and significant distress)\n- Selective mutism (consistent inability to speak in certain social situations, despite the ability to speak comfortably in other settings, primarily affecting children)\n\nPeople may experience more than one anxiety disorder at the same time. Symptoms often begin during childhood or adolescence and continue into adulthood. Girls and women are more likely to experience an anxiety disorder than boys and men.\n\n**Contributing Factors and Prevention:**\nAnxiety disorders, like other mental health conditions, result from a complex interaction of social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can have an anxiety disorder, but people who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other adverse experiences are more likely to develop one. Anxiety disorders are closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the impacts of anxiety (such as physical tension, nervous system hyperactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. In turn, people with these diseases may also find themselves experiencing anxiety disorders due to the difficulties associated with managing their conditions. Effective community-based approaches to prevent anxiety include parental education and school-based programmes to enhance social and emotional learning and build positive coping in children and adolescents. Exercise programmes can also be effective in preventing anxiety disorders in adults.\n\n**Diagnosis and Treatment:**\nThere are several effective treatments for anxiety disorders. People with symptoms of anxiety should seek care. Psychological interventions are essential treatments for anxiety disorders and refer primarily to talk therapy with professionals or supervised lay therapists. These interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking, coping or relating to their anxiety, to others or to the world. They can teach people how to face the situations, events, people or places that trigger their anxiety. Psychological interventions can be provided to individuals or groups, in person or online. They may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for treating a range of anxiety disorders are those based on principles of cognitive-behavioural therapy. These include exposure therapy, during which people learn to face their fears. In addition, learning stress management skills, such as relaxation skills and mindfulness skills, can help reduce symptoms of anxiety disorders. Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can also be useful in treating adults with anxiety disorders. Health-care providers should keep in mind the possible adverse effects associated with antidepressant medication, the ability to deliver either intervention (in terms of expertise, and/or treatment availability), and individual preferences. Benzodiazepines, which have historically been prescribed for anxiety disorders, are generally not recommended for anxiety disorders because of their high potential for dependence as well as their limited long-term effectiveness.\n\n**Self-Care:**\nSelf-care can play an important role in supporting treatment. To help manage your symptoms of anxiety and promote your overall well-being, you can:\n- Avoid or cut down on alcohol and don't use illicit drugs, which can make anxiety worse\n- Exercise regularly, even if it's just a short walk\n- Stick to regular eating and sleeping habits as much as possible and eat a healthy diet\n- Learn relaxation techniques, such as slow breathing and progressive muscle relaxation\n- Develop the habit of mindfulness meditation, even if it's just a few minutes per day\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO's Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder are included in the priority conditions covered by WHO's mhGAP Programme. This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders through care provided by health workers who are not specialists in mental health. WHO has developed brief psychological intervention manuals that may be delivered by lay therapists to individuals and groups. These interventions have been shown to be effective for multiple mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. An example is the Problem Management Plus (PM+) manual, which is based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy and uses techniques like stress management, problem solving treatment and strengthening social support. Additionally, the Self-Help Plus (SH+) group-based stress management course and WHO's popular Doing What Matters in Times of Stress self-help book describe skills that can be used to reduce anxiety and stress.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["anxiety disorders","mental health","generalized anxiety disorder","panic disorder","social anxiety disorder","agoraphobia","phobias","cognitive-behavioural therapy","mental disorders","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/anxiety-disorders","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_067","title":"Burns","body":"**Key Facts:**\nAn estimated 180,000 deaths every year are caused by burns. The vast majority occur in low- and middle-income countries. Non-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity. Burns occur mainly in the home and workplace. Burns are preventable.\n\n**Overview:**\nA burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals. Thermal (heat) burns occur when some or all the cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by:\n- Hot liquids (scalds)\n- Hot solids (contact burns)\n- Flames (flame burns)\n\n**The Problem:**\nBurns are a global public health problem, accounting for an estimated 180,000 deaths annually. The majority of these occur in low- and middle-income countries and almost two thirds occur in the WHO African and South-East Asia Regions. In many high-income countries, burn death rates have been decreasing, and the rate of child deaths from burns is currently over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Non-fatal burns are a leading cause of morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, disfigurement and disability, often with resulting stigma and rejection. Burns are among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in low- and middle-income countries. Hospitalization for burns varies by country and is influenced by health service payment programmes, but among countries studied hospitalization trends are going towards shorter stays and an increased proportion of burns being treated in specialized burn centres.\n\n**Some Country Data:**\n- In India, over 1 million people are moderately or severely burnt every year\n- Nearly 173,000 Bangladeshi children are moderately or severely burnt every year\n- In Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt and Pakistan, 17% of children with burns have a temporary disability and 18% have a permanent disability\n- Burns are the second most common injury in rural Nepal, accounting for 5% of disabilities\n- In 2008, over 410,000 burn injuries occurred in the United States of America, with approximately 40,000 requiring hospitalization\n\n**Economic Impact:**\nDirect care costs for burns vary widely but tend towards being generally expensive with a 2014 systematic review finding a mean total healthcare cost per burn patient of US$ 88,218 (range US$ 704–717,306). In South Africa an estimated US$ 26 million is spent annually for care of burns from kerosene (paraffin) cookstove incidents. Indirect costs such as lost wages, prolonged care for deformities and emotional trauma, and commitment of family resources, also contribute to the socioeconomic impact.\n\n**Who is at Risk?:**\n**Gender:** Females have slightly higher rates of death from burns compared to males according to the most recent data. This contrasts with the usual injury pattern, where rates of injury for the various injury mechanisms tend to be higher in males than females. The higher risk for females is associated with open fire cooking, or inherently unsafe cookstoves, which can ignite loose clothing. Open flames used for heating and lighting also pose risks, and self-directed or interpersonal violence are also factors (although understudied).\n\n**Age:** Along with adult women, children are particularly vulnerable to burns. Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries. While a major risk is improper adult supervision, a considerable number of burn injuries in children result from child maltreatment.\n\n**Regional Factors:** There are important regional differences in burn rates:\n- Children under 5 years of age in the WHO African Region have over 2 times the incidence of burn deaths than children under 5 years of age worldwide\n- Boys under 5 years of age living in low- and middle-income countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region are almost 2 times as likely to die from burns as boys living in the WHO European Region\n- The incidence of burn injuries requiring medical care is nearly 20 times higher in the WHO Western Pacific Region than in the WHO Region of the Americas\n\n**Socioeconomic Factors:** People living in low- and middle-income countries are at higher risk for burns than people living in high-income countries. Within all countries however, burn risk correlates with socioeconomic status.\n\n**Other Risk Factors:** There are a number of other risk factors for burns, including:\n- Occupations that increase exposure to fire\n- Poverty, overcrowding and lack of proper safety measures\n- Placement of young girls in household roles such as cooking and care of small children\n- Underlying medical conditions, including epilepsy, peripheral neuropathy, and physical and cognitive disabilities\n- Alcohol abuse and smoking\n- Easy access to chemicals used for assault (such as in acid violence attacks)\n- Use of kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel source for non-electric domestic appliances\n- Inadequate safety measures for liquefied petroleum gas and electricity\n\n**In Which Settings Do Burns Occur?:**\nBurns occur mainly in the home and workplace. Community surveys in Bangladesh and Ethiopia show that 80–90% of burns occur at home. Children and women are usually burned in domestic kitchens, from upset receptacles containing hot liquids or flames, or from cookstove explosions. Men are most likely to be burned in the workplace due to fire, scalds, chemical and electrical burns.\n\n**Prevention:**\nBurns are preventable. High-income countries have made considerable progress in lowering rates of burn deaths, through a combination of prevention strategies and improvements in the care of people affected by burns. Most of these advances in prevention and care have been incompletely applied in low- and middle-income countries. Increased efforts to do so would likely lead to significant reductions in rates of burn-related death and disability.\n\nPrevention strategies should address the hazards for specific burn injuries, education for vulnerable populations and training of communities in first aid. An effective burn prevention plan should be multisectoral and include broad efforts to:\n- Improve awareness\n- Develop and enforce effective policy\n- Describe burden and identify risk factors\n- Set research priorities with promotion of promising interventions\n- Provide burn prevention programmes\n- Strengthen burn care\n- Strengthen capacities to carry out all the above\n\nIn addition, there are several specific recommendations for individuals, communities and public health officials to reduce burn risk:\n- Enclose fires and limit the height of open flames in domestic environments\n- Promote safer cookstoves and less hazardous fuels and educate regarding loose clothing\n- Apply safety regulations to housing designs and materials and encourage home inspections\n- Improve the design of cookstoves, particularly with regard to stability and prevention of access by children\n- Lower the temperature in hot water taps\n- Promote fire safety education and the use of smoke detectors, fire sprinklers and fire-escape systems in homes\n- Promote the introduction of and compliance with industrial safety regulations, and the use of fire-retardant fabrics for children's sleepwear\n- Avoid smoking in bed and encourage the use of child-resistant lighters\n- Promote legislation mandating the production of fire-safe cigarettes\n- Improve treatment of epilepsy, particularly in developing countries\n- Encourage further development of burn-care systems, including the training of health-care providers in the appropriate triage and management of people with burns\n- Support the development and distribution of fire-retardant aprons to be used while cooking around an open flame or kerosene stove\n\n**First Aid:**\n**What to do:**\n- Stop the burning process by removing clothing and irrigating the burns\n- Extinguish flames by allowing the patient to roll on the ground, or by applying a blanket, or by using water or other fire-extinguishing liquids\n- Use cool running water to reduce the temperature of the burn\n- In chemical burns, remove or dilute the chemical agent by irrigating with large volumes of water\n- Wrap the patient in a clean cloth or sheet and transport to the nearest appropriate facility for medical care\n\n**What not to do:**\n- Do not start first aid before ensuring your own safety (switch off electrical current, wear gloves for chemicals etc.)\n- Do not apply paste, oil, haldi (turmeric) or raw cotton to the burn\n- Do not apply ice because it deepens the injury\n- Avoid prolonged cooling with water because it will lead to hypothermia\n- Do not open blisters until topical antimicrobials can be applied, such as by a health-care provider\n- Do not apply any material directly to the wound as it might become infected\n- Avoid application of topical medication until the patient has been placed under appropriate medical care\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO is promoting interventions that have been shown to be successful in reducing the incidence of burns. The Organization is also supporting the development and use of a global burn registry for globally harmonized data collection on burns and increased collaboration between global and national networks to increase the number of effective programmes for burn prevention.","category":"Injuries and Violence","tags":["burns","thermal burns","burn injuries","first aid","burn prevention","injury prevention","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/burns","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_068","title":"Post-traumatic stress disorder","body":"**Key Facts:**\nAn estimated 3.9% of the world population has had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at some stage in their lives. Most people exposed to potentially traumatic events do not develop PTSD. Feeling supported by family, friends or other people following the potentially traumatic event can reduce the risk of developing PTSD. More women are affected by PTSD than men. There are effective treatments for PTSD.\n\n**Overview:**\nMany people feel extreme fear during or after witnessing or experiencing potentially traumatic events, such as war, accidents, natural disasters or sexual violence. Most people exposed to such events will experience distress but will recover naturally with time. Some people continue to experience a range of mental health conditions that can persist for months or even years, including PTSD, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Around 70% of people globally will experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime, but only a minority (5.6%) will go on to develop PTSD. An estimated 3.9% of the world population has experienced PTSD at some point in their lives. The likelihood of developing PTSD varies depending on the type of traumatic event experienced. For example, rates of PTSD are more than three times (15.3%) higher among people exposed to violent conflict or war. PTSD rates are especially high following sexual violence. Up to 40% of people with PTSD recover within one year. There are many effective treatments for PTSD, yet only 1 in 4 people with PTSD in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) report seeking any form of treatment. Barriers to care include lack of awareness that PTSD can be treated, lack of availability of mental health services, social stigma and lack of trained mental health care providers.\n\n**Symptoms and Patterns:**\nExperiencing distress or other mental health difficulties after a potentially traumatic event is common but does not mean someone is experiencing PTSD. Someone experiences PTSD when they have symptoms re-experiencing the event, avoid reminders of the event and experience symptoms of heightened arousal that cause significant distress, and interfere with daily activities and family, social, school or working life.\n\n**Re-experiencing Symptoms:**\nPeople with PTSD have repeated and unwanted recollections of the traumatic event(s), which make them feel as if the event(s) is happening all over again. These memories are accompanied by intense fear or horror. They may be experienced as images, sounds (e.g. gunfire), smells (e.g. the odour of an assailant) or other sensations. These recollections might occur through intrusive memories, nightmares, or, in severe cases, flashbacks. During flashbacks, the person might momentarily believe and act as if they were back at the time of the event, experiencing it again.\n\n**Avoidance Symptoms:**\nPeople with PTSD avoid situations, activities, thoughts or memories that remind them of the traumatic event(s). They may even avoid talking about the event(s) with their family or health care providers. People usually use these strategies to try to avoid distressing recollections. Yet avoidance strategies may inadvertently intensify re-experiencing symptoms over time and thus perpetuate the presence of PTSD.\n\n**Hyperarousal Symptoms:**\nPeople with PTSD may experience a heightened sense of danger, even when they are not actually at risk. This can involve them being much more vigilant than usual, for example constantly scanning their surroundings for potential threats or feeling the need to sit with their back against a wall in public places. They may be more easily startled or jumpy, reacting with excessive fear to sudden movements or loud noises.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD typically begin immediately after or within one month of a traumatic event. In younger children, symptoms are often behavioural and can include re-enacting the traumatic event during play or in drawings. Children often unjustly blame themselves for what happened. The experience of PTSD can also vary across cultures. For instance, in some cultures, it may be more acceptable to express anger about the event, making this a more prominent experience. In other cultures, people with PTSD may more commonly have physical complaints with unclear causes, such as headaches or gastrointestinal symptoms. People with PTSD may also have depressive disorder, anxiety disorders and substance use disorders as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Many of the effects of PTSD (such as physical tension or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for physical diseases such as cardiovascular disease.\n\n**Contributing Factors:**\nPTSD, like other mental health conditions, results from interacting social, psychological and biological factors. Anyone can experience PTSD after a potentially traumatic event, but people who have previously experienced traumatic events are more susceptible. Women are more likely to experience PTSD than men. Other factors, including a family history of mental health conditions, younger age, and lower levels of education, can also increase the likelihood of developing PTSD after a potentially traumatic experience. The nature of the event experienced can also affect the chances of developing PTSD. For example, experiencing ongoing or repeated potentially traumatic events, developing a serious physical injury during the event(s), or witnessing harm to others can all increase risk. Receiving social support following potentially traumatic events can reduce the risk for PTSD.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThere are many effective treatments for people with PTSD. Evidence-based psychological interventions are the first choice treatments and can be delivered to individuals or groups, in person or online. Some may also be accessed through self-help manuals, websites and apps. Psychological interventions can help people learn new ways of thinking and coping that may reduce their symptoms. They can help people manage difficult situations and address the events, people or places that trigger their traumatic memories. The psychological interventions with the most evidence for effective treatment of PTSD are those based on cognitive behavioural therapy with a trauma focus and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Many of these involve exposure techniques, in which the person is asked to recall, narrate or imagine the traumatic event(s) so that they are exposed to their memories within a safe and supportive environment. Psychological interventions for PTSD may also include real or imagined exposure to triggers that may evoke traumatic memories.\n\n**Self-Care:**\nSelf-care can have an important role in supporting treatment for PTSD. To help manage symptoms and promote overall well-being, a person can:\n- Continue normal daily routines as far as possible\n- Connect with and talk to trusted people about what happened but only when the person feels ready to do so\n- Avoid or cut down on alcohol and illicit drugs that can make symptoms worse\n- Exercise regularly, even if it's just a short walk\n- Maintain or develop healthy sleeping habits\n- Learn stress management, which may include breathing techniques and progressive muscle relaxation\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO's Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013–2030 highlights the actions required to provide appropriate interventions for people with mental health conditions, including people exposed to potentially traumatic events and experiencing PTSD. PTSD is included in the priority conditions covered by WHO's mhGAP Programme, which includes guidelines for managing PTSD. This programme aims to help countries increase services for people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialized settings in LMICs and is being implemented in more than 100 countries. WHO responds to the mental health needs of people exposed to conflict and natural disasters in a range of countries and, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has published an mhGAP Humanitarian Intervention Guide, which includes a module on managing PTSD in non-specialized health care settings during emergencies.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["PTSD","post-traumatic stress disorder","trauma","mental health","traumatic stress","cognitive behavioural therapy","EMDR","mental disorders","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/post-traumatic-stress-disorder","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_069","title":"Bipolar disorder","body":"**Key Facts:**\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition that affects a person's mood, energy, activity and thought and is characterized by manic (or hypomanic) and depressive episodes. An estimated 1 in 200 (or 37 million) people live with bipolar disorder worldwide. Bipolar disorder is associated with significant disability and difficulties in many areas of life. Many people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed or untreated and experience discrimination and stigma. There are a range of effective care options, which combine medicines and psychosocial interventions to help people with bipolar disorder stay well.\n\n**Overview:**\nIn 2021, an estimated 37 million people (or 0.5% of the global population), including approximately 34 million adults, were living with bipolar disorder. The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed. Worldwide, the treatment coverage for people with bipolar disorder is low. Both men and women are often misdiagnosed. Many lack access to services and recommended interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Stigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder are widespread, both in communities and health services. This can undermine access to health care. It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing. Bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care. On average, people with bipolar disorder die on average 13 years earlier than the general population.\n\n**Symptoms and Patterns:**\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by mood swings from one extreme to another. During a manic episode, a person experiences an extremely high mood with lots of energy (feeling very happy, excited, overactive). They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual).\n\nIn manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include:\n- Highly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem\n- Talking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next\n- Having trouble concentrating and being easily distracted\n- Decreased need for sleep\n- Reckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others\n- Fixed and mistaken grandiose or persecutory beliefs in something untrue (e.g. \"I am a very famous person\", \"My neighbour is spying on me\")\n\nOn the contrary, during a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty). They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed. Other symptoms are also present, which may include:\n- Poor concentration\n- Feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth\n- Hopelessness about the future\n- Thoughts about dying or suicide\n- Disrupted sleep\n- Changes in appetite or weight\n- Feeling very tired or low in energy\n\nA depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. Both manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school. They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others.\n\nSome people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the person's ability to function to the same extent.\n\nThere are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes:\n- People with **bipolar type I disorder** experience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes)\n- People with **bipolar type II disorder** have had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes\n\n**Risks and Protective Factors:**\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Several factors – including biological (e.g. genetic), psychological, social and structural factors – may contribute to its onset, trajectory and outcomes. Adverse circumstances or life-altering events can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar disorder. These may include bereavement, violence or the breakdown of a relationship. The use of alcohol or drugs can also influence the onset and trajectory of bipolar disorder. Although employment can be a source of stress for people living with bipolar disorder, it can also be protective. Under good working conditions, and when supported at their workplace with reasonable adjustments, employment can promote recovery by improving functioning, reducing symptoms and leading to a higher quality of life and improved self-esteem.\n\n**Treatment and Care:**\nEven though symptoms often recur, recovery is possible. With appropriate care, people with bipolar disorder can cope with their symptoms and live meaningful and productive lives. There are a range of effective treatment options, typically a mix of medicines and psychological and psychosocial interventions. Medicines are considered essential for treatment, but themselves are usually insufficient to achieve full recovery. People with bipolar disorder should be treated with respect and dignity and should be meaningfully involved in care choices, including through shared decision-making regarding treatment and care, balancing effectiveness, side-effects and individual preferences.\n\n**Medicines:**\nPeople with bipolar disorder need treatment and care across acute episodes of mania and depression and when indicated, longer-term treatment to prevent relapse. Mood stabilizers (such as lithium, valproate) and antipsychotics are proven to help manage acute mania. Lithium prescription requires clinical and laboratory monitoring. Girls and women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or have childbearing potential should not use valproate. Lithium and carbamazepine also need to be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding whenever possible. Antidepressants should not be taken during a manic episode and they may be combined with mood stabilizers or antipsychotics during episodes of depression. Some medicines for bipolar disorder can make people feel sleepy, have involuntary muscle spasms or tremors, or experience metabolic changes (e.g. involving weight gain). These side effects can affect adherence to treatment and should be monitored and managed. Adults with bipolar disorder who are in complete remission (no symptoms) usually need to continue with mood stabilizers or antipsychotic medicines for at least six months. Those experiencing multiple episodes of mania and depression will usually require longer-term treatment to minimize relapses.\n\n**Psychological and Psychosocial Interventions:**\nPeople with bipolar disorder can benefit from lifestyle changes involving regular sleep, physical activity, a healthy diet, reduction of stressors, and mood monitoring. Psychological interventions (e.g. cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal therapy, psychoeducation) can effectively reduce depressive symptoms and the possibility of them coming back. Family psychoeducation can also help families understand and support their loved one better. Support from family and friends is very important. Support groups – where people can receive encouragement, learn coping skills, and share experiences – can be helpful to people with bipolar disorder and their families. Recovery-oriented psychosocial interventions include supported employment, supported housing, peer support, and social and life skills training. They serve to promote hope and to support the autonomy, personal empowerment and social inclusion of people with bipolar disorder. Medicines and psychological or psychosocial interventions should be tailored to the needs of the person and combined for best outcomes.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nThe Comprehensive mental health action plan 2013-2030 highlights the steps needed to provide appropriate services for people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards the plan's objectives by ensuring 100 million more people can access quality and affordable care for mental health conditions. WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), which is being implemented in more than 100 countries, provides evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to build capacities and expand treatment coverage for a set of priority conditions, including bipolar disorder, in non-specialized settings in LMICs. WHO's guidelines on Management of physical health conditions in adults with severe mental disorders provide evidence-based recommendations to practitioners on how to recognize and manage comorbid physical and mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. WHO's QualityRights initiative aims to improve the quality of care and human rights standards in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder. The Guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches describes what person-centred and human rights-based approaches look like in mental health, and give examples of good practice services.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["bipolar disorder","mental health","manic episodes","depressive episodes","mood disorders","bipolar type I","bipolar type II","mental disorders","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/bipolar-disorder","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_070","title":"Schizophrenia","body":"**Key Facts:**\nSchizophrenia causes psychosis, is associated with considerable disability and may affect all areas of life, including personal, family, social, educational, and occupational functioning. Stigma, discrimination, and violation of human rights of people with schizophrenia are common. More than two out of three people with psychosis in the world do not receive specialist mental health care. A range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exists and at least one in three people with schizophrenia will be able to fully recover.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSchizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in the way reality is perceived and changes in behaviour related to:\n- Persistent delusions: the person has fixed beliefs that something is true, despite evidence to the contrary\n- Persistent hallucinations: the person may hear, smell, see, touch, or feel things that are not there\n- Experiences of influence, control or passivity: the experience that one's feelings, impulses, actions, or thoughts are not generated by oneself, are being placed in one's mind or withdrawn from one's mind by others, or that one's thoughts are being broadcast to others\n- Disorganized thinking, which is often observed as jumbled or irrelevant speech\n- Highly disorganised behaviour e.g. the person does things that appear bizarre or purposeless, or the person has unpredictable or inappropriate emotional responses that interfere with their ability to organise their behaviour\n- \"Negative symptoms\" such as very limited speech, restricted experience and expression of emotions, inability to experience interest or pleasure, and social withdrawal\n- Extreme agitation or slowing of movements, maintenance of unusual postures\n\nPeople with schizophrenia often also experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive or thinking skills, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving. At least one third of people with schizophrenia experiences complete remission of symptoms. Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over time.\n\n**Magnitude and Impact:**\nSchizophrenia affects approximately 23 million people or 1 in 345 people (0.29%) worldwide. The rate is 1 in 233 people (0.43%) among adults. It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the twenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women. Schizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life. People with schizophrenia die nine years earlier than the general population. This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings. Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships with others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment. During humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with schizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms. During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion.\n\n**Causes of Schizophrenia:**\nResearch has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia. It is thought that an interaction between genes and a range of environmental factors may cause schizophrenia. Psychosocial factors may also affect the onset and course of schizophrenia. Heavy use of cannabis is associated with an elevated risk of the disorder.\n\n**Services:**\nCurrently, the vast majority of people with schizophrenia around the world are not receiving mental health care. Approximately 50% of people in mental hospitals have a schizophrenia diagnosis. Only 29% of people with psychosis receive specialist mental health care. Most resources for mental health services are inefficiently spent on care within mental hospitals. There is clear evidence that mental hospitals are not effective in providing the care that people with mental health conditions need and, regularly, violate the basic human rights of persons with schizophrenia. Efforts to transfer care from mental health institutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated. Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services. Options for community-based mental health care include integration in primary health and general hospital care, community mental health centres, day centres, supported housing, and outreach services for home-based support. The engagement of the person with schizophrenia, family members and the wider community in providing support is important.\n\n**Management and Support:**\nA range of effective care options for people with schizophrenia exist, and these include medication, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy and psychosocial rehabilitation (e.g. life skills training). Facilitated assisted living, supported housing and supported employment are essential care options that should be available for people with schizophrenia. A recovery-oriented approach – giving people agency in treatment decisions – is essential for people with schizophrenia and for their families and/or caregivers as well.\n\n**WHO Response:**\nWHO's Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 highlights the steps required to provide appropriate services for people with mental disorders including schizophrenia. A key recommendation of the Action Plan is to shift services from institutions to the community. The WHO Special Initiative for Mental Health aims to further progress towards objectives of the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030 by ensuring 100 million more people have access to quality and affordable care for mental health conditions. WHO's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) uses evidence-based technical guidance, tools and training packages to expand service in countries, especially in resource-poor settings. It focuses on a prioritized set of conditions, including psychosis, directing capacity building towards non-specialized health-care providers in an integrated approach that promotes mental health at all levels of care. Currently mhGAP is being implemented in more than 100 WHO Member States. The WHO QualityRights Project involves improving the quality of care and human rights conditions in mental health and social care facilities and to empower organizations to advocate for the health of people with mental health conditions and psychosocial disabilities. The WHO guidance on community mental health services and person-centred and rights-based approaches provides information and support to all stakeholders who wish to develop or transform their mental health system and services to align with international human rights standards including the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["schizophrenia","psychosis","mental health","mental disorders","delusions","hallucinations","cognitive-behavioural therapy","psychosocial rehabilitation","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_071","title":"Social Connection","body":"**Key Facts:**\nStaying connected to others creates feelings of belonging and being loved, cared for, and valued. Social connections are important to our mental and physical health. Being connected to others helps protect against serious illness and disease. People with stronger social bonds are more likely to live longer, healthier lives.\n\n**Overview:**\nSocial connection is the size and diversity of one's social network and roles, the functions these relationships serve, and their positive or negative qualities. Social connectedness reflects the continuum of meeting social connection needs. It is the degree to which you have the number, quality, and variety of relationships that you want. It is when you feel like you belong and have the support and care that you need. Supportive social connections can lead to longer and healthier lives.\n\n**Why It's Important:**\n**Protection against chronic disease and serious illness:**\nHigh-quality relationships can help people live longer, healthier lives. Social connection can help reduce the risk of chronic disease and serious illness, such as:\n- Heart disease\n- Stroke\n- Dementia\n- Depression and anxiety\n\n**Positive health benefits:**\nSocial connection can lead to longer life, better health, and well-being. It can improve:\n- Our ability to manage stress, anxiety, and depression\n- Healthy eating habits and physical activity\n- Quality of sleep\n\n**How It Works:**\n**Creating social connections:**\nPeople are social creatures by nature. Our relationships with family, friends, coworkers, and community members are important to our survival. Stable and supportive relationships give us the support we need to cope with stressful life challenges. People with healthy relationships are more likely to make healthy choices that lead to better mental and physical health.\n\nSocial connections give us:\n- **Emotional support:** people we can turn to during good times and hard times\n- **Physical support:**\n  - A ride to the doctor or grocery store\n  - Help with childcare on short notice\n\n**Community Connections:**\nCommunities that offer supportive connections are just as important. They can help create trust and resilience among community members in public places, such as:\n- Neighborhoods\n- Schools\n- Places of worship\n- Workplaces\n- Parks and recreation centers\n\nHaving safe access to public areas for people to connect encourages:\n- Connections among people in the community\n- Less social isolation and loneliness\n- Community members to give back, further strengthening the bonds","category":"Public Health","tags":["social connection","social connectedness","mental health","physical health","chronic disease prevention","social isolation","loneliness","community health","public health","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/social-connectedness/about/index.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_072","title":"Mindfulness Matters","body":"**Overview:**\nMindfulness is the practice of being completely aware of what is happening in the present moment—of everything occurring inside you and around you—without judgment or preconceived notions. Rather than living life on “autopilot,” mindfulness invites you to experience life as it unfolds, good and bad alike. Researchers such as Dr. Margaret Chesney (University of California, San Francisco) emphasize that mindfulness is widely accessible and can benefit many people.\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nStudies supported by the NIH suggest that mindfulness practices can help people manage stress, cope with serious illness, and reduce anxiety and depression. People who practice mindfulness often report greater relaxation, more enthusiasm for life, and improved self-esteem. One NIH-supported study linked mindfulness meditation to measurable changes in brain regions involved in memory, learning, and emotion. Another NIH-funded project showed that mindfulness practices may reduce anxiety and hostility among urban youth, leading to lower stress, fewer fights, and better relationships. Mindfulness also encourages healthier habits such as mindful eating—waiting until you’re hungry, savoring each bite, and stopping when you’re full.\n\n**Putting Mindfulness into Daily Life:**\nFinding time for mindfulness in a fast-paced, multitasking culture can be challenging, but it is within reach. You can practice mindfulness while answering emails, sitting in traffic, or waiting in line by simply becoming aware of your breath, your feet on the ground, your fingers typing, or the sounds around you. As you learn to be more mindful, it’s normal to notice how frequently your mind races to the past or future. Just acknowledge those thoughts and gently return your attention to the present. Small, regular steps create a more mindful, healthier life.\n\n**Wise Choices: Being Mindful**\n- **Take deep breaths.** Inhale through your nose to a count of four, hold for one second, then exhale through your mouth to a count of five. Repeat often.\n- **Enjoy a stroll.** While walking, notice your breath and the sights and sounds around you. When worries arise, recognize them and return your focus to the present.\n- **Practice mindful eating.** Pay attention to the taste, textures, and aromas of each bite, and listen to your body when you’re hungry or full.\n- **Explore mindfulness resources.** Look for community offerings such as yoga or meditation classes, mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, and books that can support your practice.\n\nMindfulness is a simple concept that requires commitment and practice. Taking even a few moments each day to be fully present can foster both mental and physical well-being.","category":"Wellness","tags":["mindfulness","meditation","stress management","mental health","NIH"],"source":"NIH News in Health","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2012/01/mindfulness-matters","year":2012}

{"id":"DOC_073","title":"Self-care for health and well-being","body":"**Key Facts:**\nSelf-care is the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote and maintain their own health, prevent disease, and cope with illness – with or without the support of a health or care worker. Self-care interventions can include medicines, devices, diagnostics and digital tools, while self-care actions include practices, habits and lifestyle choices. Self-sampling of human papillomavirus (HPV) is an effective self-care intervention to screen for cervical cancer. Male and female condoms are highly effective self-care interventions in preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV, when supported by non-judgmental, person-centered information. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is critical for diabetes management, and self-monitoring of blood pressure is effective for hypertension management. Appropriate self-care can reduce mortality and morbidity from the abuse of alcohol, substances and tobacco. Regular physical activity is a form of self-care that can avert an estimated 3.9 million premature deaths each year.\n\n**Overview:**\nWHO defines self-care as the ability of individuals, families and communities to promote their own health, prevent disease, maintain health and cope with illness with or without the support of a health or care worker. Self-care recognizes people as active agents in managing their health across health promotion, disease prevention and control, self-management, providing care to dependents, and rehabilitation, including palliative care. It adds options to, rather than replaces, the health care system.\n\n**Self-care health interventions:**\nSelf-care interventions encompass tools that support self-care (medicines, devices, diagnostics, digital interventions) and actions that improve self-care (practices and lifestyle choices). Some individuals can use interventions independently, while others need support or initiation from health workers; such interventions must remain linked to the health system to remain safe and effective.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nEach year, 100 million people are pushed into poverty due to out-of-pocket health expenses. Underserved and marginalized populations often lack access to quality health information, services and products, and face stigma and discrimination in health care. Self-care interventions offer innovative strategies beyond conventional health sector responses. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored their critical role, from mask use and physical distancing to rapid testing. Self-care actions to bolster emotional resilience are also important for health and care workers.\n\n**Challenges:**\nBefore recommending specific self-care interventions, evidence must show they are beneficial and safe. Challenges include unregulated or substandard products, incorrect or unclear information, and lack of access to health workers or facilities for guidance. Ensuring that products are affordable and available to those who need them is essential. Creating enabling environments requires collaboration beyond the health sector, including education, justice and social services, because many interventions are accessed outside formal health services.\n\n**Complementing the health system:**\nSelf-care interventions can advance universal health coverage, support people in humanitarian settings, and enhance health and well-being. WHO’s conceptual framework combines people-centered and health-systems approaches, grounded in human rights, ethics and gender equality. Self-care can connect with digital platforms, be integrated into health worker education, and relies on strong health and digital literacy. During health system disruptions, self-care provides alternatives to facility-based services.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO recognizes the potential of self-care interventions and promotes holistic, person-centered approaches that consider individual circumstances across the life course. The consolidated guideline on self-care interventions and associated framework support innovative approaches to strengthen primary health care, accelerate universal health coverage and advance the Sustainable Development Goals. The global guideline can be adapted to local contexts, taking into account economic conditions, health services, and the needs and rights of underserved populations.","category":"Public Health","tags":["self-care","health promotion","WHO","universal health coverage","public health"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/self-care-health-interventions","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_077","title":"Rheumatoid arthritis","body":"**Key Facts:**\nIn 2019, 18 million people worldwide were living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). About 70% are women, and 55% are older than 55 years. Thirteen million people experience moderate or severe disease that could benefit from rehabilitation. Although RA is a systemic autoimmune disease, joints of the hands, wrists, feet, ankles, knees, shoulders and elbows are most often affected.\n\n**Overview:**\nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that typically presents with joint pain. Untreated, it can severely damage joints and surrounding tissue and lead to heart, lung or nervous system complications. Symptoms include chronic pain, stiffness, tenderness, warmth and swelling in affected joints, making daily activities difficult. The exact cause is unknown, but risk factors include smoking, obesity, air pollution, female sex and older age. Timely diagnosis allows disease control through medicines, rehabilitation and, in severe cases, surgery (e.g., joint replacement) to restore movement or manage pain.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nRA usually begins in adults in their sixties. Women are two to three times more affected than men. Prevalence is higher in industrialized countries, reflecting demographics, environmental exposures and lifestyle risks, as well as under-diagnosis elsewhere.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nRA causes inflammation and pain in one or more joints, most commonly small joints of the hands, wrists and feet. It is chronic and can worsen without treatment, harming joints and affecting organs such as the heart, lungs and nervous system. Early symptoms include pain, stiffness, tenderness, and swelling or redness in joints, typically symmetrically (e.g., both hands). Symptoms can spread to knees, elbows or shoulders, limiting daily activities. People may experience fatigue, malaise (fever, poor sleep, loss of appetite), depressive symptoms, difficulties with sexual function, reduced physical fitness, loss of independence and reduced ability to work.\n\n**Causes and risk factors:**\nSpecific causes remain unknown. Modifiable risks include smoking and obesity; non-modifiable risks include genetics, female sex and older age.\n\n**Prevention and control:**\nPrevention focuses on reducing inhaled silica and occupational exposures, avoiding tobacco use, maintaining healthy nutrition, physical activity, normal body weight and good dental hygiene. Some evidence suggests that breastfeeding may protect mothers.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nRA is not curable. Management requires multidisciplinary care and individualized rehabilitation. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce symptoms, slow disease progression and prevent disability; remission is possible in some cases. Approaches aim to maintain joint mobility and muscle strength, reduce pain and improve functional capacity. Assistive technologies (orthoses, self-care devices) help protect joints and support independence. Medicines may include NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biological agents. Severe cases may need orthopedic surgery to relieve pain and restore movement, with rehabilitation essential afterwards. Education, counseling, healthy lifestyle and workplace support help people manage symptoms.\n\n**Self-care:**\nBecause RA affects many life domains, lifestyle changes are often required for individuals and families. Education and support enable coping strategies. Healthy habits—regular physical activity, balanced diet, stress management—are important.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO expands access to RA care through several initiatives. The Rehabilitation 2030 Package of Interventions outlines essential rehabilitation actions and assistive products for conditions including RA. Under the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing, WHO promotes reorienting health and care systems to meet older adults’ needs. The Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach supports person-centered assessments and tailored health and social care, including guidance to prevent loss of locomotor and psychological capacity due to pain.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["rheumatoid arthritis","autoimmune disease","rehabilitation","WHO","musculoskeletal health"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rheumatoid-arthritis","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_078","title":"Lupus Basics","body":"**Key Facts:**\nLupus is a long-term autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body. Its wide range of signs and symptoms makes it difficult to diagnose. There is no cure, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help treat and manage it.\n\n**What it is:**\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus, is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack healthy cells and tissues, leading to inflammation and organ damage. Because symptoms vary widely—from mild to life-threatening—lupus can be hard to diagnose. Early diagnosis allows for better treatment and management.\n\n**Causes:**\nThe precise causes are unknown. Possible links include environmental exposures, family history (genetics) and hormonal factors. Having a close relative with lupus slightly increases a person’s risk, although most people with lupus do not have affected family members.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nLupus is often mistaken for other diseases, so diagnosis can be challenging. Rheumatologists, who specialize in joint, muscle and connective tissue conditions, typically lead diagnosis. There is no single test; physicians review symptoms, perform physical exams, order imaging (e.g., X-rays) and run laboratory tests.\n\n**Managing symptoms:**\nBecause symptoms vary person to person, management depends on individual needs. Best practices include regular doctor visits, taking prescribed medicines and adhering to a treatment plan.\n\n**Staying healthy:**\nHealthy choices and self-management skills help people live better with lupus. Recommended actions include:\n- Staying physically active\n- Eating nutritious foods\n- Getting adequate rest\n- Avoiding smoking\n- Using sunscreen and limiting sun exposure\n\nSelf-management education helps people develop skills to manage daily activities, take medications correctly, communicate with healthcare providers, boost energy and manage pain.\n\n**Treatment and recovery:**\nTreatment goals are to manage current symptoms, prevent flares, minimize joint and organ damage and reduce inflammation. A multidisciplinary team—primary care providers, rheumatologists, pain specialists, physical therapists and others—may collaborate on care. Main treatments use medications that suppress the immune system, such as:\n- Hydroxychloroquine (also used for malaria)\n- Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)\n- Biologics (e.g., belimumab, rituximab)\n\n**Factors that worsen lupus:**\nLack of access to health care, delayed diagnosis and not following treatment plans can increase flares and overall risk.","category":"Public Health","tags":["lupus","autoimmune disease","CDC","chronic disease","self-management"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/lupus/about/","year":2024}

It causes irritation, redness, swelling and bleeding of the gingiva—the gum tissue around the base of the teeth. Gingivitis itself doesn’t cause bone loss, but if untreated it can progress to periodontitis and lead to tooth loss. The most common cause is inadequate oral hygiene. Brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and seeing a dentist regularly can help prevent or reverse gingivitis.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nHealthy gums are firm, pale pink and fit snugly around teeth. Signs of gingivitis include swollen or puffy gums; bright red or dark red gums; gums that bleed easily during brushing or flossing; tenderness; and bad breath.\n\n**When to see a dentist:**\nIf you notice symptoms of gingivitis, schedule a dental visit promptly. Early treatment improves the chances of reversing the disease and preventing periodontitis. If symptoms don’t improve, a dentist may refer you to a periodontist—an expert in gum diseases.","category":"Public Health","tags":["gingivitis","gum disease","oral health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gingivitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354453","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_081","title":"Tonsillitis","body":"**Overview:**\nTonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils—two oval pads of tissue at the back of the throat, one on each side. It occurs mostly in children and teens. Most cases are caused by common viruses, though bacteria (notably group A streptococcus) can also be responsible. Treatment depends on the cause, so a prompt diagnosis is important. Surgery (tonsillectomy) is now reserved for recurrent, treatment-resistant or complicated cases.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon symptoms include red, swollen tonsils; white or yellow coatings or patches on the tonsils; sore throat; pain or difficulty swallowing; fever; enlarged, tender lymph nodes in the neck; a scratchy, muffled or throaty voice; bad breath; stomachache; neck pain or stiffness; and headache. Younger children who can’t describe symptoms may drool due to painful swallowing, refuse food or be unusually fussy.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nSeek medical advice if a child has a sore throat with fever, a sore throat lasting more than 24–48 hours, painful or difficult swallowing, or marked weakness, fatigue or irritability. Get immediate care if there is trouble breathing, severe difficulty swallowing or excessive drooling.\n\n**Causes:**\nMost tonsillitis is viral in origin. Bacterial infections, especially group A streptococcus (strep throat), can also cause it. Tonsils act as part of the immune system’s first line of defense, which exposes them to frequent infections. Their immune activity decreases after puberty, so adults are less often affected.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nThe main risk factors are young age (especially 5–15 years for bacterial tonsillitis) and close contact with others (e.g., school settings) where germs spread easily.\n\n**Complications:**\nRecurrent or chronic tonsillitis can lead to obstructive sleep apnea, tonsillar cellulitis (infection spreading deeper into tissue) or peritonsillar abscess (pus buildup near a tonsil). Untreated group A strep infections can lead to rheumatic fever, scarlet fever complications, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation) and post-streptococcal reactive arthritis.\n\n**Prevention:**\nTo reduce spread of viral and bacterial causes, teach children to wash hands frequently, avoid sharing utensils or drinks and replace toothbrushes after a diagnosis. Keep ill children home until they’re no longer contagious, and encourage covering coughs or sneezes with tissues or elbows.","category":"Public Health","tags":["tonsillitis","upper respiratory infection","children's health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tonsillitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20378479","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_082","title":"Chronic sinusitis","body":"**Overview:**\nChronic sinusitis (chronic rhinosinusitis) is long-lasting inflammation and swelling of the sinus cavities that persists for 12 weeks or longer despite treatment. It blocks mucus drainage, causes nasal stuffiness and makes breathing through the nose difficult. Infection, nasal polyps and chronic tissue swelling can all contribute. The condition affects both adults and children.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon signs include thick, discolored nasal mucus; postnasal drip; persistent nasal congestion; pain, tenderness or swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead; and reduced sense of smell and taste. Other symptoms may involve ear pain, headaches, aching teeth, cough, sore throat, bad breath and fatigue. Unlike acute sinusitis, fever is uncommon in chronic cases.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nSchedule an appointment for repeated sinusitis episodes, symptoms that last more than 10 days or situations where treatment isn’t helping. Seek urgent medical care for possible serious infection if you develop fever, swelling or redness around the eyes, severe headache, forehead swelling, confusion, double vision or other vision changes, or a stiff neck.","category":"Public Health","tags":["chronic sinusitis","rhinosinusitis","respiratory health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-sinusitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351661","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_083","title":"Ear Infection Basics","body":"**Key Facts:**\nEar pain in children may signal an ear infection. Some middle ear infections need antibiotics, but many improve without them. Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best approach.\n\n**Overview:**\nChildren get ear infections more often than adults. Main types include:\n- **Middle ear infection (acute otitis media):** Infection in the middle ear.\n- **Otitis media with effusion:** Fluid buildup in the middle ear without infection; usually no fever, pain or pus.\n- **Swimmer’s ear (otitis externa):** Infection of the outer ear canal, distinct from middle ear infections.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nEar pain, fever, fussiness or irritability, rubbing or tugging at an ear and trouble sleeping.\n\n**Causes:**\nBacteria (especially *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Haemophilus influenzae* nontypeable) and viruses (such as those causing colds) commonly cause middle ear infections.\n\n**Prevention:**\nStay healthy and protect others by getting recommended vaccines (flu, pneumococcal), washing hands, breastfeeding (exclusively until 6 months and then continuing through 12 months), avoiding tobacco smoke exposure and drying ears thoroughly after swimming.\n\n**When to seek medical care:**\nConsult a healthcare provider for fever ≥102.2°F (39°C), ear discharge, worsening symptoms, symptoms lasting more than 2–3 days, or hearing loss. Seek immediate care for infants under 3 months with fever ≥100.4°F (38°C).\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nHealthcare providers diagnose middle ear infections by reviewing symptoms and examining the ears, especially the eardrum, for signs of infection or fluid.\n\n**Treatment:**\nThe immune system often clears mild middle ear infections without antibiotics. Severe infections or those lasting longer than 2–3 days need antibiotics. For mild infections, clinicians may recommend **watchful waiting** (observing for 2–3 days before deciding on antibiotics) or **delayed prescribing** (issuing a prescription but advising to wait 2–3 days before filling it unless symptoms persist).\n\n**How to feel better:**\nRest, stay hydrated, and use over-the-counter pain or fever relievers as directed. These measures can ease symptoms with or without antibiotics.\n\n**Over-the-counter medicine and children:**\nUse OTC medicines only as directed. Pain relievers: infants under 6 months should receive only acetaminophen; older children can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen; never give aspirin (risk of Reye’s syndrome). Cough and cold medicines: avoid in children under 4 unless directed by a healthcare provider. Always confirm appropriate dosages and inform your child’s provider about all medications they take.","category":"Public Health","tags":["ear infections","otitis media","pediatrics","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/ear-infection/about/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_084","title":"Osteoarthritis","body":"**Key Facts:**\nIn 2019, an estimated 528 million people worldwide were living with osteoarthritis (an increase of 113% since 1990). About 73% are older than 55 years and 60% are female. The knee is the most frequently affected joint (365 million), followed by the hip and hand. Some 344 million people have moderate or severe disease that could benefit from rehabilitation. With aging populations and rising obesity and injury rates, prevalence is expected to keep increasing. Osteoarthritis is not an inevitable part of aging.\n\n**Overview:**\nOsteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease causing pain, swelling and stiffness, limiting free movement. It affects the whole joint—including surrounding tissues—and is most common in knees, hips, spine and hands. Risk factors include joint injury or overuse, older age, and overweight; women are more affected than men. Exercise and healthy eating help maintain strong muscles and weight, reducing symptoms. Severe cases may require joint replacement surgery. Chronic pain and mobility loss can restrict participation in daily activities and lead to decreased well-being and psychological distress.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nOsteoarthritis significantly contributes to years lived with disability. Because it is more prevalent in older adults (about 70% are over 55), global prevalence will rise as populations age. Typical onset occurs from the late 40s to mid-50s, but younger people—including athletes and those with joint injuries—can be affected. About 60% of people with osteoarthritis are women.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nSymptoms include joint pain, swelling, stiffness and limited movement. Reduced mobility often leads to muscle weakness and difficulty performing physical activities. Although any joint can be affected, knees, hips, spine and small hand joints are most common. Symptoms may develop slowly or appear after injury/strain and usually progress over time. Severe disease can render the joint unusable and cause pain even at rest. Reduced activity can promote other conditions (cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes). Osteoarthritis can dramatically reduce quality of life and affect mental health, sleep and relationships.\n\n**Causes and risk factors:**\nRisk factors include joint injury (fractures, strains, repetitive stress), pre-existing joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, gout), specific metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes), obesity (especially for hip and knee disease), genetics, and sociodemographic factors (older age, female sex).\n\n**Prevention and control:**\nStrategies focus on reducing joint overuse (e.g., workload modifications) and promoting healthy lifestyles—regular physical activity and maintaining normal body weight.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nCare typically involves a multidisciplinary team delivering tailored rehabilitation. Early diagnosis and adherence to treatment plans slow progression and optimize function. Exercise strengthens muscles and improves mobility; other therapies help joints move properly so daily activities can continue. Braces and assistive technologies support independence. NSAIDs are commonly prescribed for pain. Joint replacement surgery (hip, knee) can relieve pain and restore movement in severely affected joints. Maintaining healthy weight, plus education and counseling, supports symptom management and work-related tasks. Most guidelines advise against opioid analgesics, glucosamine, viscosupplementation and stem cell therapy due to limited evidence of benefit.\n\n**Self-care:**\nSelf-care is vital. Education and support help people cope with physical and mental effects. Staying active and keeping a healthy weight can lessen symptoms and slow progression. Individuals should work with health workers to create personalized care plans.\n\n**WHO response:**\nThrough WHO’s Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative, osteoarthritis is included in the Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation, outlining essential rehab measures and assistive products. Under the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing, WHO urges health systems to promote healthy ageing and address diverse needs of older adults. The Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach guides person-centred assessments and tailored health and social care—aimed at preventing loss of locomotor and psychological capacity due to pain.","category":"Public Health","tags":["osteoarthritis","musculoskeletal health","rehabilitation","WHO","noncommunicable diseases"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_085","title":"Low back pain","body":"**Key Facts:**\nIn 2020, low back pain (LBP) affected 619 million people globally; projections suggest 843 million cases by 2050 due to population growth and ageing. LBP is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the condition for which the greatest number of people may benefit from rehabilitation. Most people experience LBP at least once in their lifetime. Prevalence rises with age up to 80 years and peaks in absolute numbers at 50–55 years; women are affected more often. About 90% of cases are non-specific.\n\n**Overview:**\nLow back pain refers to pain between the lower edge of the ribs and the buttocks. It may be acute (<6 weeks), sub-acute (6–12 weeks) or chronic (>12 weeks), and affects all ages. LBP limits movement, daily activities, mental well-being and social participation, often causing loss of work productivity. LBP can be specific (due to identifiable disease or structural problems) or non-specific (no clear pathology). Rehabilitation is essential at all stages to help people understand their pain, return to meaningful activities, and develop strategies for recovery and improved function.\n\n**Scope of the problem:**\nLBP has the highest global prevalence among musculoskeletal conditions and is the top cause of disability. People of any age, including children, can experience LBP. Cases peak between 50 and 55 years, with women more frequently affected. The burden is highest in people aged 80–85. Recurrent episodes are common with ageing. Chronic LBP significantly impacts quality of life and creates large economic burdens worldwide, making it a public health priority.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nLBP may be a dull ache or sharp pain and can radiate to the legs. It restricts movement and affects work, school, sleep, mood and social engagement. LBP can be acute, sub-acute or chronic. Acute episodes often resolve on their own, but some progress to chronic pain. Associated leg pain (sciatica or radicular pain) may feel like dull pressure or sharp electric shocks, sometimes accompanied by numbness, tingling or muscle weakness. Radicular symptoms typically indicate spinal nerve root involvement. These experiences can cause significant disability, loss of income and psychological distress.\n\n**Cause and risk factors:**\nNon-specific LBP (about 90% of cases) lacks a specific disease or tissue damage explanation. Risk factors include low physical activity, smoking, obesity and high physical stress at work. Specific LBP may stem from underlying diseases (e.g., cancer), tissue damage (fracture), or referred pain from other organs (kidney, aortic aneurysm).\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nManagement depends on whether LBP is specific or non-specific. Specific LBP requires treatment of the underlying condition. Non-specific LBP treatment includes physical therapies to improve strength and movement, psychological and social support to manage pain and restore desired activities, reducing strain during physical work, and lifestyle changes (increased physical activity, healthy diet, good sleep habits). Medicines can relieve symptoms but shouldn’t be first-line therapy; older adults and those with comorbidities should consult health providers before using them. Comprehensive assessment—physical, psychosocial and preference-based—is crucial to tailor care. Long-standing LBP necessitates a biopsychosocial approach and rehabilitation interventions (primarily non-pharmacologic) to maintain independence and participation.\n\n**Self-care:**\nSelf-management strategies include being physically active, supporting mental well-being, keeping a healthy weight, avoiding tobacco, getting good sleep, staying socially and occupationally engaged, and making ergonomic workplace adjustments. Education and support help people develop coping strategies, reduce disease impact and improve well-being.\n\n**WHO response:**\nThrough the Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative, WHO’s Package of Interventions for Rehabilitation outlines essential rehabilitation measures for conditions including LBP. Under the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing, WHO advocates reorienting health systems to meet older adults’ diverse needs. The Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) approach promotes person-centred assessments to guide personalized health and social care, preventing loss of locomotor and psychological capacity due to pain. WHO is also developing guidelines for managing chronic primary low back pain in adults in primary and community care settings.","category":"Public Health","tags":["low back pain","musculoskeletal health","rehabilitation","WHO","chronic pain"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/low-back-pain","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_086","title":"Sciatica","body":"**Overview:**\nSciatica describes pain that follows the path of the sciatic nerve, running from the lower back through the buttock and down each leg. It usually occurs when a herniated disk or bone overgrowth compresses lumbar nerve roots, causing inflammation, pain and sometimes numbness. Although the pain can be intense, sciatica from a herniated disk often improves with treatment in a few weeks to months. Severe cases with marked leg weakness or bowel/bladder changes may require surgery.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nPain can radiate anywhere along the nerve but commonly travels from the lower back to the buttock and down the back of the thigh and calf. It may feel like a mild ache, a sharp burning sensation, or a jolt or electric shock. Symptoms often worsen when coughing, sneezing or sitting for long periods. Typically only one side of the body is affected. Some people also experience numbness, tingling or muscle weakness in the leg or foot; one area may be painful while another feels numb.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nMild sciatica often resolves over time. Contact a healthcare professional if self-care doesn’t relieve symptoms, the pain lasts longer than a week, is severe or worsening. Seek immediate medical care for sudden numbness or weakness in a leg, pain after a violent injury, or loss of bowel/bladder control.\n\n**Causes:**\nSciatica occurs when nerve roots to the sciatic nerve are pinched, most commonly by a herniated spinal disk or bone spur. Rarely, tumors or other conditions can compress the nerve.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nAge (herniated disks are more common between ages 20–50; bone spurs increase with age), obesity (extra stress on the spine), occupations requiring heavy lifting, twisting or prolonged driving, extended sitting, and diabetes (which raises the risk of nerve damage).\n\n**Complications:**\nMost people recover fully, but untreated nerve compression can cause permanent nerve damage. Immediate care is critical if leg sensation or strength diminishes, or if bowel/bladder control is lost.\n\n**Prevention:**\nAlthough not always preventable, maintaining back health can reduce risk. Exercise regularly to strengthen core muscles for spine support. Practice good sitting posture with proper lower back support, level hips and knees, and use cushions or rolled towels to maintain lumbar curvature. Use correct body mechanics—rest one foot on a stool when standing long periods, lift with the legs, avoid lifting and twisting simultaneously, and ask for help with heavy loads.","category":"Public Health","tags":["sciatica","nerve pain","musculoskeletal","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sciatica/symptoms-causes/syc-20377435","year":2024}

There is no cure, but symptoms can be managed with self-care, therapies and medicines.\n\n**Overview:**\nFibromyalgia leads to chronic pain that can occur all over the body, on one side, or above/below the waist. It affects millions of people in the United States, including children, though it is most common in adults. People with fibromyalgia may process pain differently (“abnormal pain perception”). The condition often co-occurs with other health problems such as major depressive disorders and types of arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). Fibromyalgia can reduce quality of life and increase hospitalizations.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nCommon symptoms include: pain and stiffness throughout the body, fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and issues with thinking, memory and concentration. Headaches (including migraines) are frequent. Other symptoms may include numbness or tingling in hands and feet, facial or jaw pain (e.g., TMJ disorders) and digestive issues such as stomach pain, bloating, constipation or irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nExact causes are unknown. Triggers may include stressful or traumatic events, repeat injuries, and illnesses (including viral infections). People aged 30–50, women, individuals with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, and those with a family history of fibromyalgia are more likely to develop it.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nDoctors diagnose fibromyalgia through physical exams, imaging such as X-rays, lab tests and review of medical history.\n\n**Treatment:**\nAlthough there is no cure, treatments aim to manage symptoms. Health care providers may recommend a multidisciplinary team that includes primary care, rheumatology, pain management, physical therapy, mental health support, sleep specialists and physiologists. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help address negative thoughts and coping strategies. Medicines—prescription or over-the-counter pain relievers—may be used.\n\n**Self-care:**\nSelf-management strategies include learning symptom-management skills, staying physically active, maintaining a healthy weight, protecting joints, practicing good sleep habits, managing stress and staying in communication with a health care provider.","category":"Public Health","tags":["fibromyalgia","chronic pain","CDC","self-management","rheumatology"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-disease/fibromyalgia/","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_088","title":"Fatty liver disease","body":"**Overview:**\nFatty liver disease occurs when excess fat builds up in liver cells and interferes with normal function. It has become increasingly common and often has no symptoms, though fatigue or upper-right abdominal discomfort can occur. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects about one-third of U.S. adults and is especially common among people with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Heavy alcohol use can also cause fatty liver (alcohol-associated fatty liver disease). Emerging research links environmental toxins—such as vinyl chloride and other persistent chemicals—to higher risk, particularly when combined with other risk factors.\n\n**Progression and detection:**\nMost people with fatty liver do not develop serious complications, but some progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by inflammation and liver cell damage. NASH can advance to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer. Physicians often detect fatty liver through blood tests or imaging ordered for other reasons. Those at higher risk may need targeted blood or imaging tests to determine severity. A liver biopsy remains the only definitive test for NASH but carries risks like bleeding or infection, so researchers are developing noninvasive imaging techniques to measure liver fat and scarring.\n\n**Management:**\nThe liver can repair itself if fatty liver is caught early. Lifestyle changes are the most effective treatment. Significant weight loss (about 7% of body weight to resolve NASH, at least 10% to reduce fibrosis) can reverse damage and reduce the risk of heart disease—the leading cause of death in NAFLD. People should follow balanced nutrition, increase physical activity, limit alcohol use and avoid weight gain. Washing fruits and vegetables may reduce pesticide exposure. No FDA-approved drugs specifically treat fatty liver disease yet, but vitamin E and some diabetes medications that cause weight loss can help certain patients with NASH. New therapies are being tested in clinical trials.\n\n**Prevention and Wise Choices:**\nAim for a healthy weight and maintain gradual weight loss if needed. Limit saturated fat intake, choose healthier unsaturated fats (fish, flaxseeds, walnuts) and increase fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Avoid foods and drinks high in sugars, especially fructose-sweetened beverages. Drink alcohol in moderation, quit smoking and reduce exposure to environmental toxins when possible. These steps help protect liver health and reduce the likelihood of fatty liver disease progression.","category":"Public Health","tags":["fatty liver disease","NAFLD","NASH","liver health","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/10/fighting-fatty-liver","year":2021}

{"id":"DOC_089","title":"Gallstones","body":"**Overview:**\nGallstones are hardened deposits of bile that form in the gallbladder, a small organ beneath the liver that stores bile before releasing it into the small intestine. They can range from tiny grains to golf-ball-sized stones. Many gallstones cause no symptoms and require no treatment. When gallstones block bile ducts and cause symptoms, gallbladder removal surgery is often needed.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nGallstones may be silent. Symptoms arise if a stone lodges in a duct, leading to sudden, rapidly intensifying pain in the upper right abdomen or center of the abdomen below the breastbone, back pain between the shoulder blades, pain in the right shoulder, and nausea or vomiting. Episodes can last minutes to hours.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nConsult a doctor if you have worrying symptoms. Seek immediate medical care for intense abdominal pain, jaundice, or high fever with chills.\n\n**Causes:**\nExact causes are unclear. Gallstones may form when bile contains too much cholesterol, too much bilirubin, or when the gallbladder doesn’t empty properly. Types include cholesterol gallstones (usually yellow) and pigment gallstones (dark brown or black due to excess bilirubin).\n\n**Risk factors:**\nRisk rises with being female, age 40+, Native American or of Mexican Hispanic origin, overweight or obese, sedentary, pregnant, eating high-fat/high-cholesterol/low-fiber diets, family history of gallstones, diabetes, certain blood disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia, leukemia), rapid weight loss, estrogen-containing medications, and liver disease.\n\n**Complications:**\nPossible complications include gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis), common bile duct blockage leading to pain, jaundice, or infection, pancreatic duct blockage causing pancreatitis, and a slightly elevated risk of gallbladder cancer (still rare overall).\n\n**Prevention:**\nReduce risk by not skipping meals, losing weight slowly (1–2 pounds per week), increasing dietary fiber (fruits, vegetables, whole grains), and maintaining a healthy weight through balanced diet and physical activity.","category":"Public Health","tags":["gallstones","biliary disease","digestive health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gallstones/symptoms-causes/syc-20354214","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_090","title":"Atopic dermatitis (eczema)","body":"**Overview:**\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema) causes dry, itchy, inflamed skin. It’s common in young children but can occur at any age. The condition is chronic, flares periodically, and isn’t contagious. People with atopic dermatitis have increased risk of food allergies, hay fever, and asthma. Moisturizing and good skin-care habits can relieve itching and prevent flares; medicated ointments or creams may be added.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSigns can appear anywhere on the body and vary by person. They include dry, cracked skin; itching; rashes on swollen skin (color varies by skin tone); small raised bumps on brown or Black skin; oozing and crusting; thickened skin; darkening around the eyes; and raw, sensitive skin from scratching. Symptoms often begin before age 5 and may continue into adulthood, flaring then clearing for years.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nConsult a healthcare provider if symptoms occur, if itching disrupts sleep or daily activities, if infection signs appear (streaks, pus, yellow scabs), or if symptoms persist despite self-care. Seek urgent medical attention for fever plus an infected-looking rash.\n\n**Causes:**\nSome people carry gene variations that weaken the skin barrier, reducing moisture retention and protection against irritants, allergens, and bacteria. Others may have excess *Staphylococcus aureus* on the skin, displacing beneficial bacteria and disrupting the barrier. A weak barrier can trigger immune responses that lead to inflammation. Atopic dermatitis is one type of dermatitis (others include contact and seborrheic dermatitis) and is not contagious.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nThe main risk factor is personal or family history of eczema, allergies, hay fever, or asthma.\n\n**Complications:**\nPossible complications include asthma and hay fever, food allergies (often presenting with hives), neurodermatitis (thickened, discolored skin from habitual scratching), post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation (especially in darker skin), skin infections from scratching, irritant hand dermatitis (notably in people with frequent wet work), allergic contact dermatitis, sleep disturbances, and mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.\n\n**Prevention:**\nA basic skin-care routine helps prevent flares: moisturize at least twice daily (creams, ointments, shea butter, lotions), and for infants, petroleum jelly may prevent eczema. Bathe or shower daily with warm—not hot—water for about 10 minutes. Use gentle, nonsoap cleansers without dyes, alcohols, or fragrances; young children often need only warm water.

{"id":"DOC_091","title":"Atopic dermatitis (eczema)","body":"**Overview:**\nAtopic dermatitis (eczema) is a chronic condition marked by dry, itchy, inflamed skin. It most often affects children but can occur at any age. Flares come and go, and the condition is not contagious. People with atopic dermatitis have higher risk of food allergies, hay fever and asthma. Regular moisturizing and a consistent skin-care routine help relieve itching and prevent flares; treatments can include medicated ointments or creams.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSigns vary widely in location, appearance and intensity. They include dry, cracked skin; itching; rashes on swollen skin (with color differences based on skin tone); small raised bumps on brown or Black skin; oozing and crusting; thickened skin; darkening around the eyes; and raw, sensitive skin from scratching. The disease often begins before age five and can persist into adulthood, with periods of remission.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nConsult a health-care provider if symptoms appear, sleep or daily activities are affected, signs of infection develop (new streaks, pus, yellow scabs), or symptoms persist despite self-care. Seek immediate medical attention if fever accompanies an infected-looking rash.\n\n**Causes:**\nIn some people, gene variations weaken the skin barrier, reducing moisture retention and defense against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors (e.g., tobacco smoke). In others, excessive *Staphylococcus aureus* on the skin displaces beneficial bacteria and disrupts the barrier, triggering inflammation. The weakened barrier can prompt immune responses that worsen symptoms. Atopic dermatitis is one of several dermatitis types (others include contact and seborrheic); none are contagious.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nPersonal or family history of eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma increases risk. Having these conditions in the past or having relatives with them is the primary risk factor.\n\n**Complications:**\nPossible complications include asthma and hay fever, food allergies (often presenting as hives), chronic itchy/scaly skin (neurodermatitis), post-inflammatory hyper- or hypopigmentation (especially in darker skin), skin infections due to scratching, irritant hand dermatitis (common with frequent wet work and harsh soaps), allergic contact dermatitis, sleep disturbances from itching, and mental health issues (depression, anxiety) linked to persistent symptoms.\n\n**Prevention:**\nA basic skin-care routine helps prevent flares. Moisturize at least twice daily with creams, ointments, shea butter or lotions; petroleum jelly on babies may prevent eczema. Bathe or shower daily with warm water for ~10 minutes, using gentle, nonsoap cleansers free of dyes, alcohols and fragrances. Young children often need only warm water. Avoid deodorant or antibacterial soaps and harsh scrubbing. After bathing, pat skin dry and apply moisturizer within three minutes. Identify and avoid personal triggers (e.g., rough wool, dry skin, infections, heat/sweat, stress, cleaning products, dust mites, pet dander, mold, pollen, tobacco smoke, cold/dry air, fragrances, other irritants). Infants or children may have food-triggered flares (e.g., eggs, cow’s milk); discuss potential allergies with a provider.","category":"Public Health","tags":["atopic dermatitis","eczema","skin inflammation","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/symptoms-causes/syc-20353273","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_092","title":"Dermatitis","body":"**Overview:**\nDermatitis is a group of conditions that cause skin swelling and irritation. It can lead to itchy, dry skin, rashes, blisters, oozing, crusting or flaking. Common types include atopic dermatitis (eczema), contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Dermatitis isn’t contagious but can be uncomfortable. Regular moisturizing helps control symptoms; treatment may include medicated ointments, creams or shampoos.\n\n**Types:**\n- Atopic dermatitis (eczema)\n- Contact dermatitis\n- Cradle cap\n- Diaper rash\n- Seborrheic dermatitis\n\n**Symptoms:**\nEach type affects different body areas, but symptoms may include painful itchiness; dry, cracked, scaly skin (more typical on white skin); rash on swollen skin (color varies by skin tone); blisters that ooze or crust; dandruff; thickened skin; and small raised bumps (more typical on brown or Black skin).\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nConsult a doctor if discomfort affects sleep or daily activities, if skin becomes painful, if signs of infection appear (streaks, pus, yellow scabs), or if symptoms persist despite self-care. Seek immediate medical attention if fever accompanies an infected-looking rash.\n\n**Causes:**\nDermatitis often results from contact with irritants or allergens (e.g., poison ivy, perfume, nickel). Other causes include dry skin, viral infections, bacteria, stress, genetics and immune system issues. Atopic dermatitis involves a hypersensitive skin barrier similar to asthma or hay fever affecting other organs.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nAge (atopic dermatitis is more common in children and often begins in infancy), personal or family history of eczema/allergies/asthma, occupations with exposure to metals, solvents or cleaners (e.g., health care workers with hand eczema), and health conditions like Parkinson’s disease or immunodeficiency (linked to seborrheic dermatitis).\n\n**Complications:**\nPersistent scratching can break the skin, leading to bacterial or fungal infections that rarely become serious. In people with brown or Black skin, dermatitis may cause post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, taking months or years to fade.\n\n**Prevention:**\nWear protective clothing when handling irritants or caustic chemicals. For skin care, take shorter baths/showers (~10 minutes) with lukewarm water and consider bath oil. Use mild, dye-free, alcohol-free, fragrance-free cleansers; young children often need only warm water. Avoid scrubbing with washcloths or loofahs. Pat skin dry with a soft towel and moisturize while skin is damp. Apply unscented moisturizers (e.g., Vanicream, Eucerin, CeraVe, Cetaphil) throughout the day as needed to seal in moisture and reduce flares.","category":"Public Health","tags":["dermatitis","eczema","skin inflammation","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatitis-eczema/symptoms-causes/syc-20352380","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_093","title":"Cataracts","body":"**Overview:**\nA cataract is clouding of the eye’s lens, normally clear. Cataracts make vision appear foggy or blurry—like looking through a frosted window—making it harder to read, drive at night, or recognize faces. Most cataracts develop slowly and may not affect vision early on, but over time they worsen. Brighter lighting and stronger eyeglasses may help initially. When vision loss interferes with daily tasks, cataract surgery—generally safe and effective—may be needed.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon symptoms include clouded, blurred or dim vision; difficulty seeing at night; light and glare sensitivity; need for brighter light to read; seeing halos around lights; frequent changes in prescription eyewear; fading or yellowing of colors; and double vision in one eye. Early cataracts may affect only a small part of the lens, so vision changes might not be noticeable. As the cataract grows, more of the lens is clouded and symptoms become more apparent.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nSchedule an eye exam if you notice vision changes. Seek medical care right away for sudden double vision, flashes of light, sudden eye pain, or a severe headache.\n\n**Causes:**\nMost cataracts result from aging or injury that alters lens tissues. Proteins and fibers break down and clump, causing hazy vision. Genetic disorders, other eye conditions, past eye surgeries, diabetes, and long-term steroid use can raise risk. As lenses age, they become thicker, less clear, and less flexible, leading to clouding.\n\n**Types of cataracts:**\n- **Nuclear cataracts** (center of lens): initially blur distant vision but may temporarily improve near vision; eventually lenses yellow/brown, impairing color perception.\n- **Cortical cataracts** (edges): white wedge-shaped streaks spread toward the center, interfering with light passage.\n- **Posterior subcapsular cataracts** (back of lens): small spots near the light path that affect reading vision, cause glare or halos, and typically progress quickly.\n- **Congenital cataracts:** present at birth or early childhood; may result from hereditary factors, infections or trauma in utero, or conditions like myotonic dystrophy, galactosemia, neurofibromatosis type 2 or rubella. They may not always impair vision but are usually removed if they do.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nAge, diabetes, excessive sunlight exposure, smoking, obesity, family history, prior eye injury/inflammation/surgery, long-term corticosteroid use, and excessive alcohol intake.\n\n**Prevention:**\nNo proven methods prevent cataracts, but strategies may include: regular eye exams to detect issues early; not smoking; managing health conditions like diabetes; eating fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and antioxidants; wearing UVB-blocking sunglasses outdoors; and limiting alcohol use.","category":"Public Health","tags":["cataracts","vision","eye health","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cataracts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353790","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_094","title":"Glaucoma","body":"**Key Facts:**\nGlaucoma damages the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss or blindness. Nearly half of affected people don’t know they have it because early symptoms are rare. Learning about glaucoma and taking action early helps reduce vision loss risk.\n\n**Overview:**\nGlaucoma refers to a group of diseases that damage the optic nerve. About 3 million Americans have glaucoma; it’s the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Open-angle glaucoma, the most common form, involves increased eye pressure and often has no early signs. There is no cure yet, but early detection can preserve sight.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nAnyone can develop glaucoma, but risk is higher for Black people over age 40, all people over age 60, individuals with a family history of glaucoma, and people with diabetes. Black people are 6–8 times more likely to develop glaucoma than White people, and diabetes doubles the risk.\n\n**Prevent vision loss:**\nProtect your eyes and lower risk by scheduling comprehensive dilated eye exams—especially if you’re high risk—to catch glaucoma early. Medicare covers yearly glaucoma tests for high-risk individuals. Talk with family members about vision health, since open-angle glaucoma runs in families. Adopt healthy habits: maintain a healthy weight, control blood pressure, stay physically active, and avoid smoking. These practices also reduce risk for type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions.\n\n**Manage and treat glaucoma:**\nGlaucoma usually affects peripheral vision first, then central vision. Treatments—eye drops, oral medicines, laser or surgical procedures, or combinations—lower eye pressure and can prevent or delay permanent vision loss. Use medicines as prescribed and report side effects. Keep regular follow-up appointments to monitor eye pressure.","category":"Public Health","tags":["glaucoma","vision health","optic nerve","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/vision-health/about-eye-disorders/glaucoma.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_095","title":"Sjogren's syndrome","body":"**Overview:**\nSjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder defined by dry eyes and dry mouth caused by immune attack on moisture-secreting glands. It often coexists with other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Although it can appear at any age, most diagnoses occur after age 40 and women are affected far more often. Treatment centers on symptom relief.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Dry eyes that burn, itch, or feel gritty\n- Dry mouth that feels cottony and makes swallowing or speaking difficult\n- Joint pain, swelling, or stiffness\n- Swollen salivary glands near the jaw and ears\n- Skin rashes or dry skin\n- Vaginal dryness\n- Persistent dry cough\n- Prolonged fatigue\n\n**Causes:**\nSjogren's is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells attack glands producing tears and saliva. Genetic susceptibility plus triggers such as infections may initiate the response. The immune attack can also involve joints, thyroid, kidneys, liver, lungs, skin, and nerves.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Age over 40 years\n- Female sex\n- Existing rheumatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)\n\n**Complications:**\nCommon issues include dental cavities, oral yeast infections, and vision problems (light sensitivity, blurred vision, corneal damage) due to lack of saliva and tears. Less common complications involve lungs, kidneys, or liver (pneumonia, bronchitis, renal dysfunction, hepatitis, cirrhosis), lymph nodes (increased lymphoma risk), and nerves (peripheral neuropathy with numbness, tingling, or burning).","category":"Autoimmune Diseases","tags":["sjogren's syndrome","autoimmune","dry eyes","dry mouth","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sjogrens-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353216","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_096","title":"Diabetic retinopathy","body":"**Overview:**\nDiabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that damages retinal blood vessels. It can arise in anyone with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and risk rises with disease duration and poor glucose control. Early stages may be symptom-free, but unmanaged disease can cause severe vision loss or blindness.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Floaters (spots or dark strings)\n- Blurred vision\n- Fluctuating or changing vision\n- Dark or empty areas in the visual field\n- Vision loss\n\nSeek prompt eye care if vision becomes blurry, spotty, or hazy. People with diabetes—including those who develop gestational diabetes—should get yearly dilated eye exams, with more frequent checks during pregnancy if advised.\n\n**Causes and types:**\nChronic high blood sugar harms tiny retinal vessels, reducing blood supply. In advanced disease, the eye grows abnormal new vessels that leak easily.\n- **Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR):** Vessel walls weaken, forming bulges that leak fluid or blood. Swelling in larger vessels and macular edema can occur, progressing from mild to severe as more vessels are damaged.\n- **Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR):** Closed vessels spur growth of fragile new vessels that bleed into the vitreous. Scar tissue can pull the retina away (detachment) and blocked fluid drainage can raise eye pressure, causing glaucoma.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Long duration of diabetes\n- Poor glycemic control\n- High blood pressure\n- High cholesterol\n- Pregnancy\n- Tobacco use\n- Being Black, Latino, or Native American\n\n**Complications:**\n- **Vitreous hemorrhage:** Bleeding into the vitreous causes floaters or vision loss; vision often returns once blood clears if the retina is unharmed.\n- **Retinal detachment:** Scar tissue can separate the retina, leading to flashes, floaters, missing vision areas, or severe loss.\n- **Glaucoma:** New vessels on the iris block fluid drainage, raising pressure and damaging the optic nerve.\n- **Blindness:** Diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and glaucoma can collectively result in permanent vision loss.\n\n**Prevention:**\nRegular eye exams, tight blood sugar and blood pressure control, and rapid treatment of vision changes help prevent vision loss. Manage diabetes with healthy eating, activity (e.g., 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly), and prescribed medicines or insulin. Monitor blood glucose, track A1C goals, control lipids, stop smoking, and report sudden vision changes immediately. Proper diabetes management can prevent or delay retinopathy.","category":"Eye Conditions","tags":["diabetic retinopathy","diabetes","vision health","retina","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_097","title":"Toxic shock syndrome","body":"**Overview:**\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare, potentially fatal complication of certain bacterial infections. It is most often caused by toxins from *Staphylococcus aureus* (staph) but can also result from group A streptococcus (strep). Anyone can develop TSS. Risk increases with skin wounds, recent surgery, and use of tampons or other vaginal devices (menstrual cups, birth control sponges, diaphragms) left in place too long.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nTSS develops suddenly and may include:\n- High fever\n- Low blood pressure\n- Vomiting or diarrhea\n- Sunburn-like rash, especially on palms and soles\n- Confusion\n- Muscle aches\n- Red eyes, mouth, and throat\n- Seizures\n- Headaches\n\n**When to seek care:**\nContact a healthcare professional immediately if TSS symptoms appear, particularly if you use tampons or have a skin or wound infection.\n\n**Causes:**\nToxins produced by staph bacteria most commonly cause TSS. Strep bacteria toxins can also trigger the syndrome.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nWhile TSS can affect anyone, about half of staph-related cases occur in people who menstruate. Strep TSS occurs across all ages. Factors tied to higher risk include:\n- Cuts or burns\n- Recent surgery\n- Use of birth control sponges, diaphragms, high-absorbency tampons, or menstrual cups for prolonged periods\n- Viral infections such as flu or chickenpox\n\n**Complications:**\nTSS can progress quickly and may lead to shock, kidney (renal) failure, damage to other organs including the heart and liver, or death.\n\n**Prevention:**\nThe FDA reviews tampons for safety and bacterial growth risk. To lower TSS risk:\n- Use the lowest absorbency tampon needed\n- Change tampons every 4–8 hours\n- Alternate between tampons and sanitary napkins, using mini pads or liners when flow is light\n- Avoid tampons if you’ve had TSS or other serious staph or strep infections\n\nPrompt recognition of symptoms and medical care are critical because TSS can recur.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["toxic shock syndrome","staphylococcus aureus","streptococcus","tampon safety","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355384","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_098","title":"Anaphylaxis","body":"**Overview:**\nAnaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to allergens such as foods, medications, insect stings, or latex. Sudden immune activation releases chemicals that trigger shock, marked by sharp blood pressure drops and airway narrowing. Immediate intramuscular epinephrine and emergency care are critical; without rapid treatment, anaphylaxis can be fatal.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSymptoms typically start within minutes but occasionally appear later. Signs include:\n- Hives, itching, flushed or pale skin\n- Low blood pressure (hypotension)\n- Airway constriction and swelling of tongue or throat causing wheezing or breathing difficulty\n- Weak, rapid pulse\n- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\n- Dizziness or fainting\n\n**When to seek care:**\nSeek emergency help immediately when severe allergy symptoms occur—don’t wait to see if they improve. Use an epinephrine autoinjector promptly if available, then go to the emergency department even if symptoms improve to monitor for biphasic reactions. Follow up with an allergist/immunologist for diagnosis and long-term management after any severe attack.\n\n**Causes:**\nAnaphylaxis occurs when the immune system overreacts to otherwise harmless substances, releasing mediators that affect the whole body. Common triggers include:\n- Foods (peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, soy, sesame, milk)\n- Medications (antibiotics, aspirin, other pain relievers, IV contrast)\n- Insect venom (bees, wasps, hornets, yellow jackets, fire ants)\n- Latex\nLess commonly, exercise (sometimes combined with specific foods or extreme temperatures) triggers symptoms. Some cases remain idiopathic.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Previous anaphylaxis (future reactions may be more severe)\n- Existing allergies or asthma\n- Certain medical conditions such as heart disease or mastocytosis\n\n**Complications:**\nAnaphylaxis can stop breathing or heartbeat, making rapid intervention essential.\n\n**Prevention:**\nAvoid known triggers and:\n- Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace\n- Keep an emergency kit with prescribed medications; monitor epinephrine autoinjector expiration dates\n- Inform healthcare providers about drug reactions\n- Take precautions around stinging insects (protective clothing, avoid bright colors or scents, don’t go barefoot, cover drinks)\n- For food allergies, read labels carefully, recheck frequent items, and question restaurant staff about ingredients and preparation\n\nEven with caution, accidental exposures may happen.

It most often follows a large or severe heart attack but can also result from other cardiac injuries. Although rare, it is frequently fatal without immediate treatment.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCardiogenic shock signs include very fast breathing, severe shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, weak pulse, low blood pressure, sweating, cold extremities, little to no urine output, and confusion or loss of consciousness. Because it commonly follows a heart attack, watch for heart attack symptoms such as chest pressure or pain, discomfort radiating to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, or upper belly, cold sweats, fatigue, heartburn-like discomfort, dizziness, nausea, or shortness of breath. Symptoms can be atypical, particularly in women.\n\n**When to seek care:**\nCall emergency services immediately if cardiogenic shock or heart attack symptoms occur. Rapid treatment improves survival and limits heart damage. Do not drive yourself to the hospital.\n\n**Causes:**\nCardiogenic shock usually occurs when the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) cannot get enough oxygen, typically due to a heart attack. Less commonly, right ventricular damage, myocarditis, infective endocarditis, generalized heart weakness, or drug overdose can trigger the condition.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Older age\n- History of heart failure or prior heart attacks\n- Existing heart or blood vessel disease\n- Diabetes or high blood pressure\n- Female sex\n\n**Complications:**\nWithout prompt treatment, cardiogenic shock can quickly lead to death or cause severe damage to organs such as the liver and kidneys due to lack of oxygen.\n\n**Prevention:**\nPrevent cardiogenic shock by reducing heart attack risk:\n- Don’t smoke and avoid secondhand smoke\n- Maintain a healthy weight\n- Eat a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while limiting sugar, salt, and saturated or trans fats\n- Manage blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes with regular checkups\n- Limit alcohol (up to one drink daily for women, two for men) or avoid it altogether\n- Exercise regularly—aim for at least 30 minutes of activity daily\n- Prioritize good sleep (7–9 hours per night for adults)\n- Manage stress through exercise, mindfulness, and social support\n\nIf a heart attack occurs, seek emergency care immediately to help prevent cardiogenic shock.","category":"Cardiovascular Diseases","tags":["cardiogenic shock","heart attack","heart failure","cardiovascular emergency","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiogenic-shock/symptoms-causes/syc-20366739","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_100","title":"Slowing Sarcopenia","body":"**Overview:**\nStarting around age 30, people naturally lose 3–5% of muscle mass every decade. Excessive loss reduces strength and can lead to sarcopenia, making everyday activities—standing from a chair, walking, opening jars, carrying groceries—more difficult and raising fall risk. Chronic illnesses, inactivity, unhealthy diet, and hormonal changes (e.g., menopause) can accelerate muscle loss. NIH experts estimate 10–20% of older adults have sarcopenia.\n\n**Understanding sarcopenia:**\nAssessing sarcopenia is challenging because there’s no single standard test. NIH-funded researchers analyzed large datasets and found grip strength and walking speed (slower than 2.6 feet per second) better predict falls, mobility limits, hip fractures, and mortality than lean body mass. As sarcopenia worsens, hospitalization risk nearly doubles, fractures and loss of independence rise, and the body struggles more to fight diseases such as cancer.\n\n**Prevention and management:**\n- **Stay active:** Regular physical activity is essential. Resistance training—push-ups, squats, weight lifting, planks, yoga poses, knee raises—builds strength. Start slowly, work all major muscle groups (arms, legs, abs, back, chest), and aim for consistent routines. Even five minutes helps when beginning.\n- **Prioritize protein:** Muscles need protein for maintenance. Eating about 1.2 grams of protein per 2 pounds of body weight supports treatment or management of sarcopenia. Include lean meats, poultry, fish, seafood, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds.\n- **Consider supplements cautiously:** Combining diet and exercise with certain supplements—amino acids, fish oil, vitamin D, selenium, magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids—may help slow muscle loss, though more research is needed.\n- **Consult healthcare providers:** If you suspect sarcopenia, talk with your doctor to design a personalized plan to preserve muscle, reduce falls, and maintain independence.\n\n**Wise choices for muscle strength:**\n- Start new exercise routines gradually and choose activities you can sustain.\n- Engage every major muscle group.\n- Focus on strength and resistance exercises (push-ups, squats, sit-ups, arm curls, planks, side twists, knee raises, arm/leg lifts).\n- Do what you can—short sessions are better than none.\n- Eat sufficient protein daily.\n- Discuss new exercise plans with your healthcare provider to choose safe options.\n\nMaintaining muscle through activity, protein-rich nutrition, and informed guidance helps slow sarcopenia and supports healthy aging.","category":"Healthy Aging","tags":["sarcopenia","muscle loss","healthy aging","resistance training","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2025/04/slowing-sarcopenia","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_101","title":"Healthy Diet","body":"A healthy diet protects against malnutrition in all its forms and helps prevent noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer. Unhealthy diets combined with physical inactivity are leading global risks to health. Healthy dietary practices begin early: exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months supports growth, cognitive development, and may lower the risk of overweight, obesity and NCDs later in life. Throughout life, energy intake should balance energy expenditure. Total fat intake should stay below 30% of total energy, with saturated fats under 10% and trans-fats under 1%, while prioritizing unsaturated fats and eliminating industrially produced trans-fats. Free sugars should be less than 10% of energy intake (with <5% for additional benefit). Salt intake should remain under 5 g per day (sodium <2 g), using iodized salt. WHO Member States aim to reduce population salt intake by 30% and halt rises in diabetes, obesity and childhood overweight by 2025.\n\n**Overview:**\nChanging lifestyles, urbanization and increased consumption of processed, energy-dense foods have shifted dietary patterns, often reducing intake of fruits, vegetables and dietary fibre. Although dietary needs vary with age, gender, activity level, culture and available foods, the core principles of balanced, diversified nutrition are consistent worldwide.\n\n**Adult dietary recommendations:**\n- Emphasize fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains (e.g., unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat, brown rice).\n- Consume at least 400 g (five portions) of fruits and vegetables daily, excluding starchy roots.\n- Limit free sugars to <10% of total energy (ideally <5%); free sugars include added sugars and those naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and concentrates.\n- Keep total fat <30% of energy, prioritizing unsaturated fats (fish, avocado, nuts, sunflower/soybean/canola/olive oils) over saturated fats (fatty meats, butter, palm or coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee, lard) and avoiding industrial trans-fats in baked/fried/pre-packaged foods as well as limiting ruminant trans-fats.\n- Limit salt to <5 g per day and ensure salt is iodized.\n\n**Infants and young children:**\n- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months.\n- Continued breastfeeding to 2 years of age and beyond.\n- From 6 months, introduce safe, nutrient-dense complementary foods without added salt or sugar while maintaining breastfeeding.\n\n**Practical guidance:**\n- **Fruit and vegetables:** Include vegetables in meals, use fresh produce as snacks, choose seasonal varieties, and eat a diverse assortment.\n- **Fats:** Keep total fat <30% of energy; reduce saturated fat to <10% and trans-fat to <1%, replacing them with unsaturated fats. Opt for steaming/boiling instead of frying, swap butter/ghee for oils rich in polyunsaturated fats, choose lean or reduced-fat animal products, and minimize baked/fried snacks containing industrial trans-fats.\n- **Salt/Sodium/Potassium:** Most individuals consume 9–12 g of salt daily—well above recommendations—and insufficient potassium (<3.5 g). Excess sodium and low potassium raise blood pressure. Reducing salt to <5 g per day could prevent 1.7 million deaths annually. Limit high-sodium condiments, remove table salt, restrict salty snacks, select lower-sodium products, and increase potassium intake via fresh fruits and vegetables.\n- **Sugars:** Limit free sugars to <10% of energy (ideally <5%). Reducing sugary snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages lowers risks of dental caries, overweight, obesity, and cardiovascular risk factors. Replace sugary snacks with fresh fruits or raw vegetables.\n\n**Promoting healthy diets:**\nDietary choices are influenced by income, food prices, culture, preferences, and environmental factors. Governments and stakeholders can create supportive food environments by aligning trade, agriculture and health policies; incentivizing production and affordability of healthy foods; discouraging processed foods high in saturated fat, trans-fat, free sugars and salt; reformulating products; implementing marketing restrictions to children; establishing nutrition standards in public institutions; adopting clear nutrition labelling (including front-of-pack labels); and offering nutrition counselling in primary care. Education and school programmes that build culinary skills and awareness further encourage healthy habits.\n\n**Infant and young child feeding promotion:**\nKey actions include enforcing the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, protecting working mothers, and supporting breastfeeding through initiatives such as the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO’s Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health (2004) mobilizes governments, partners and civil society to advance healthy diets. Additional milestones include recommendations on marketing to children (2010), the Comprehensive Implementation Plan on Maternal, Infant and Young Child Nutrition (2012), and global voluntary NCD targets (2013) calling for salt reduction and halting rises in diabetes and obesity. WHO’s Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity (2014–2016) issued context-specific strategies. Jointly with FAO, WHO convened the Second International Conference on Nutrition (2014), resulting in the Rome Declaration and Framework for Action promoting healthy diets across the life course. WHO’s Thirteenth General Programme of Work (2019–2023) prioritizes sodium reduction and elimination of industrial trans-fats, supported by the REPLACE action package. These efforts guide countries in implementing policies, nutrition targets and programmes that ensure diversified, safe and nutritious diets for all ages.","category":"Nutrition","tags":["healthy diet","nutrition","noncommunicable diseases","salt reduction","trans-fat elimination","breastfeeding","WHO guidelines"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet","year":2020}

In 2021, about 1 in 127 people worldwide had autism, though prevalence varies by study and remains unknown in many low- and middle-income countries. Characteristics can be detected in early childhood but are often diagnosed later. Autistic individuals differ widely in abilities and support needs: some live independently, while others require lifelong care. Community-level inclusion, accessibility and support are essential.\n\n**Overview:**\nASD is marked by challenges with social interaction and communication, alongside atypical behaviours such as difficulty transitioning between activities, intense focus on details, and unusual sensory responses. Autism influences education and employment opportunities, and can place substantial demands on families. Co-occurring conditions—such as epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder—are common, and intellectual functioning ranges from profound impairment to superior abilities.\n\n**Epidemiology:**\nGlobal prevalence estimates average 1 in 127 people, but figures vary greatly between studies and regions. Many LMICs lack data.\n\n**Causes and risk factors:**\nAutism likely results from multiple interacting genetic and environmental factors. Associated exposures include advanced parental age, maternal diabetes, prenatal air pollution or heavy metal exposure, prematurity, severe birth complications, low birth weight, and in-utero exposure to certain medicines (e.g., valproate, carbamazepine). Extensive evidence shows no link between autism and vaccines, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), thiomersal, or aluminium-containing vaccines. The study suggesting otherwise was fraudulent and retracted.\n\n**Assessment and care:**\nEarly identification and evidence-based psychosocial interventions improve communication, social skills, development and quality of life. Routine monitoring of child development in maternal and child health services supports earlier detection. Once diagnosed, autistic people and caregivers should receive tailored information, services, referrals and practical support. Care needs are complex, spanning health promotion, treatment, rehabilitation, and collaboration across health, education, employment and social sectors. Programmes must be co-designed with autistic people, and community-level efforts should promote accessibility and inclusion.\n\n**Human rights:**\nAutistic people have the same right to the highest attainable standard of health as others, yet often face stigma, discrimination, and denial of services, education and community participation. They share common health needs with the general population but may have additional requirements due to autism or co-occurring conditions. Behavioural risk factors (physical inactivity, poor diet) and vulnerability to violence, injury and abuse contribute to higher rates of chronic illness and premature mortality. Autistic people also face elevated unmet healthcare needs and heightened risks during humanitarian emergencies, often due to providers’ limited knowledge of autism.\n\n**Global response:**\nIn 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution urging coordinated efforts to manage ASD and strengthen national capacity. WHO works with Member States to: increase governmental commitment; guide policy and action plans across health, mental health, neurological disorders and disability; strengthen the health workforce; and foster inclusive environments with caregiver support. The Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030 and the Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and Other Neurological Disorders call for improved early detection, care, treatment and rehabilitation of neurodevelopmental conditions, as well as addressing social, economic, educational and inclusion needs and strengthening research and surveillance.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["autism","neurodevelopmental disorders","psychosocial interventions","human rights","WHO response"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/autism-spectrum-disorders","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_103","title":"Rabies","body":"Rabies is a viral, zoonotic, neglected tropical disease present in more than 150 countries, mainly across Asia and Africa. It causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, 40% in children under 15. In up to 99% of human cases, transmission follows dog bites or scratches. Once the virus reaches the central nervous system and symptoms begin, rabies is uniformly fatal. However, prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)—immediate wound cleansing, a course of human rabies vaccine, and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) when indicated—prevents the virus from entering the nervous system. Anyone bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal should seek PEP immediately. WHO and partners pursue “Zero by 30,” a One Health strategy integrating mass dog vaccination, PEP access, health worker training, surveillance, and community bite-prevention awareness.\n\n**Overview:**\nDog-mediated rabies is vaccine-preventable. The virus infects mammals (dogs, cats, livestock, wildlife) and spreads through saliva via bites, scratches, or contact with mucosa. Children aged 5–14 are frequent victims. Rabies exists on every continent except Antarctica. An estimated 59 000 people die annually, though underreporting leads to discrepancies. The global economic burden is about US$ 8.6 billion per year. Effective human vaccines and immunoglobulins exist but remain inaccessible or unaffordable for many, with PEP costs (~US$ 108 in 2018) posing hardship for low-income populations. Over 29 million people receive human rabies vaccine each year.\n\n**Non-dog sources:**\nIn the Americas, where dog-mediated rabies is largely controlled, hematophagous bats are now the primary source. Bat-mediated rabies also threatens Australia and parts of Western Europe. Human rabies from foxes, raccoons, skunks, or other wild mammals is rare; rodents are not known vectors. Inhalation of aerosolized virus, consumption of raw products from infected animals, organ transplantation, or human-to-human transmission is exceedingly rare.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nIncubation typically spans 2–3 months (range: 1 week to 1 year), influenced by exposure site and viral load. Prodromal symptoms include fever, pain, and paresthesia at the wound. As the virus invades the central nervous system, encephalomyelitis develops. Furious rabies involves hyperactivity, agitation, hallucinations, hydrophobia, aerophobia and causes death within days due to cardio-respiratory arrest. Paralytic rabies (~20% of cases) causes ascending paralysis, coma and eventual death but is often misdiagnosed, contributing to under-reporting. Once symptoms appear, survival is extremely rare and associated with severe neurological deficits; palliative care is advised.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nThere are no WHO-approved tools for early detection before symptoms. Clinical diagnosis is difficult without exposure history or classic signs (hydrophobia, aerophobia). Accurate risk assessment guides PEP decisions. Postmortem confirmation relies on detecting virus, antigen or nucleic acid in tissues (brain, skin, saliva). Where feasible, the biting animal should be tested.\n\n**Prevention:**\n- **Dog vaccination:** Mass vaccination of dogs, including puppies, is the most cost-effective prevention method. Culling free-roaming dogs is ineffective.\n- **Awareness:** Public education on dog behaviour, bite prevention, immediate wound care, and responsible pet ownership supports control efforts.\n- **Human vaccination:** Three WHO-prequalified human rabies vaccines (RABIVAX-S, VaxiRab N, VERORAB) provide pre- and post-exposure protection. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for high-risk occupations (laboratory staff, animal control, wildlife rangers), travellers or residents in remote, highly endemic areas, but does not replace PEP.\n- **Post-exposure prophylaxis:** Consists of thorough wound washing with soap and water for at least 15 minutes, a vaccine course, and RIG or monoclonal antibodies when indicated. Exposure categories guide interventions:\n  - Category I (touching/feeding animals, licks on intact skin): wash exposed skin, no PEP.\n  - Category II (nibbling of uncovered skin, minor scratches without bleeding): wound washing and immediate vaccination.\n  - Category III (transdermal bites/scratches, mucosal exposure, contact with bats): wound washing, immediate vaccination, RIG/monoclonal antibodies.\n- **Vaccine quality and administration:** WHO recommends vaccines that meet WHO standards; substandard vaccines have caused failures. WHO advises using intradermal (ID) administration instead of intramuscular (IM) to cut vaccine volume, dose counts, and costs by 60–80% while maintaining safety and efficacy, improving adherence.\n\n**WHO response:**\nRabies is part of WHO’s 2021–2030 NTD Roadmap and the “Zero by 30” Global Strategic Plan to end dog-mediated human deaths by 2030. Actions include:\n- Expanding access to human rabies vaccines via collaboration with Gavi as part of the Vaccine Investment Strategy (2021–2025) and implementation from 2024.\n- Providing technical guidance for national elimination plans, strengthening surveillance and reporting, and building One Health workforce capacity.\n- Promoting multisectoral collaboration through forums like United Against Rabies (UAR) with WHO, FAO, and WOAH to advocate for investment and coordinated action.","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["rabies","dog-mediated rabies","post-exposure prophylaxis","One Health","vaccination","neglected tropical diseases"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_104","title":"Infertility","body":"Infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Globally, an estimated 1 in 6 people of reproductive age experience infertility in their lifetime. Causes may stem from male, female, combined or unexplained factors. Infertility may be primary (no previous pregnancy) or secondary (after at least one prior pregnancy). Fertility care includes prevention, diagnosis and treatment but remains inaccessible or unaffordable for many, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and is rarely included in universal health coverage benefit packages.\n\n**Causes:**\n- **Female factors:** tubal disorders (e.g., blocked fallopian tubes from untreated STIs, complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis, pelvic surgery), uterine conditions (inflammatory such as endometriosis, congenital such as septate uterus, benign such as fibroids), ovarian disorders (e.g., polycystic ovarian syndrome, other follicular disorders), and endocrine disorders affecting the hypothalamus or pituitary (including pituitary cancers, hypopituitarism). Relative frequency varies by country, influenced by STI prevalence and demographics.\n- **Male factors:** obstruction of reproductive tract affecting semen ejection (e.g., ejaculatory duct or seminal vesicle blockages from injuries or infections), hormonal disorders involving the pituitary, hypothalamus or testicles (e.g., pituitary/testicular cancers), testicular failure to produce sperm (varicoceles, gonadotoxic treatments such as chemotherapy), and abnormal sperm morphology or motility (e.g., anabolic steroid use). Lifestyle factors (smoking, excessive alcohol, obesity) and exposure to environmental pollutants or toxins can impair gametes.\n\nSome causes are preventable. Treatment often involves assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other medically assisted reproduction.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nInfertility undermines the right to the highest attainable standard of health and the ability to decide the number, timing and spacing of children. Diverse groups—including heterosexual couples, same-sex partners, single individuals, older persons, sero-discordant HIV couples and cancer survivors—may need fertility care. Inequitable access disproportionately affects the poor, unmarried, uneducated, unemployed and marginalized. Addressing infertility also supports gender equality: women often bear stigma, violence, divorce, emotional stress, depression and anxiety regardless of actual cause. Fear of infertility can deter contraception in settings where early proof of fertility is socially valued, underscoring the need for education and awareness.\n\n**Challenges and policy actions:**\nFertility services are often absent from reproductive health strategies, underfunded, and limited by shortages of trained personnel, equipment and medicines. ART has existed for decades, but availability, accessibility and affordability remain limited, especially in LMICs. Governments can mitigate inequities by recognizing infertility as a preventable disease, integrating fertility awareness into comprehensive sexuality education, promoting healthy lifestyles, preventing and treating STIs, averting complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis and pelvic surgery, and addressing environmental toxins. Enabling laws and policies regulating third-party reproduction and ART are needed to ensure nondiscriminatory access and protect human rights. Implementation should be monitored and service quality continuously improved.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO prioritizes high-quality family planning and fertility care as core reproductive health services by:\n- collaborating with partners on global epidemiological and etiological research;\n- engaging countries in policy dialogues to create supportive legal frameworks;\n- generating data on infertility burden to guide resource allocation;\n- developing guidelines on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of male and female infertility and updating normative products (e.g., WHO laboratory manual for human semen analysis);\n- working with academic centers, ministries of health, other UN agencies and non-state actors to strengthen political commitment and health system capacity; and\n- providing technical support for national fertility policies and services.","category":"Reproductive Health","tags":["infertility","fertility care","assisted reproduction","gender equality","WHO guidelines"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/infertility","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_105","title":"Sexual Health","body":"Sexual health is fundamental to individual, familial, community and societal well-being and development. An affirmative view of sexual health requires positive, respectful approaches to sexuality and relationships, and the possibility of pleasurable, safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Achieving sexual health and well-being depends on access to comprehensive, high-quality information about sex and sexuality; awareness of risks and personal vulnerability; access to sexual health care; and supportive environments that promote sexual health. Sexual health concerns span sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, relationships and pleasure, as well as adverse outcomes such as HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reproductive tract infections (RTIs), unintended pregnancy, sexual dysfunction, sexual violence, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation (FGM).\n\n**Definitions:**\nWHO has engaged in sexual health work since at least 1974, culminating in technical consultations (2000–2002) that developed working definitions:\n- **Sex:** Biological characteristics defining humans as female or male (recognizing overlaps). The term is often used colloquially to mean sexual activity, but technically refers to biological attributes.\n- **Sexual health:** “A state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, and the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Achieving sexual health requires respect for, protection of, and fulfilment of sexual rights.” (WHO, 2006a)\n- **Sexuality:** A central aspect of being human that encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction. Sexuality is expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships, though not all dimensions are always experienced or expressed. Biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors influence sexuality.\n- **Sexual rights:** Application of existing human rights to sexuality and sexual health. Sexual rights protect everyone’s ability to fulfil and express their sexuality and enjoy sexual health, provided they respect others’ rights. These rights include equality and non-discrimination; freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; privacy; the highest attainable standard of health (including sexual health) and social security; marrying and founding a family with free and full consent and equality within marriage; deciding the number and spacing of children; access to information and education; freedom of opinion and expression; and effective remedies for rights violations. Responsible exercise of rights requires respecting others’ rights.\n\n**Issues and conceptual elements:**\nInternational human rights instruments increasingly support legal claims demanding respect, protection and fulfilment of sexual and reproductive health rights. Key conceptual elements emphasize that sexual health:\n- Concerns well-being, not just absence of disease;\n- Requires respect, safety, and freedom from discrimination and violence;\n- Depends on fulfilment of human rights;\n- Applies throughout the lifespan, for youth and older adults as well as people of reproductive age;\n- Is expressed through diverse sexualities and forms of expression;\n- Is shaped by gender norms, roles, expectations, and power dynamics;\n- Must be understood within specific social, economic and political contexts.\n\nSexual health programming therefore integrates rights-based approaches grounded in internationally recognized human rights frameworks.","category":"Public Health","tags":["sexual health","sexual rights","WHO definitions","human rights","sexuality"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/sexual-health#tab=tab_1","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_106","title":"Child Growth","body":"Child malnutrition remains a major public health issue. Globally, about 144 million children under five are stunted, 47 million are wasted and 38.3 million have overweight or obesity. Roughly 45% of deaths among children under five are linked to undernutrition. Monitoring growth is crucial for child health surveillance: inadequate infant growth due to poor nutrition can lead to undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries and later transition to overweight or obesity when calorie intake rises. The WHO Child Growth Standards help track height and weight for boys and girls from birth to five years, identifying children or populations not growing properly, underweight, or at risk of overweight to guide clinical and public health responses. These standards are used in health facilities, research institutions, advocacy organizations and ministries of health worldwide.\n\n**Impact:**\n- **Stunting:** Children too short for their age due to chronic or recurrent malnutrition. Stunting contributes to child mortality and signals development inequities.\n- **Overweight:** Children too heavy for their height, often from low energy expenditure relative to intake or endocrine imbalances, raising later-life NCD risk.\n- **Wasting:** Children too thin for their height from recent rapid weight loss or failure to gain weight. Moderate or severe wasting markedly increases mortality risk but is treatable.\nWasting and overweight can coexist in populations: in 2020, 6.7% (45.4 million) and 5.7% (38.9 million) of children under five were wasted and overweight, respectively.\n\n**Prevention:**\nIn 2020, 22% (149.2 million) of children under five were stunted, down from 24.4% in 2015, but achieving a 50% reduction by 2030 requires doubling the annual decline from 2.1% to 3.9%. Key prevention pathways are consistent across malnutrition forms: adequate maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy and breastfeeding; optimal breastfeeding in the first two years; nutritious, diverse, and safe complementary foods in early childhood; and healthy environments with access to basic health care, water, hygiene, sanitation and safe physical activity. Threats—including COVID-19 disruptions—jeopardize progress; urgent action is needed to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, especially in hard-hit regions, ensuring every child’s right to nutrition.","category":"Child Health","tags":["child growth","malnutrition","stunting","wasting","overweight","WHO growth standards"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/health-topics/child-growth#tab=tab_1","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_107","title":"Fragility Fractures","body":"In 2019 there were 178 million new fractures worldwide—33.4% more than in 1990—and 455 million prevalent cases with acute or long-term symptoms, a 70.1% increase. Fractures accounted for 25.8 million years lived with disability (YLDs), 65.3% higher than in 1990. Fractures disproportionately affect older adults, especially women; most result from bone fragility and low-energy trauma (e.g., falls from standing height). As global populations grow and age, total fracture incidence is projected to rise, but individual risk can be predicted and prevented through effective interventions.\n\n**Overview:**\nFractures are partial or complete breaks in bone that can occur spontaneously (e.g., due to osteoporosis) or from trauma (falls, road crashes, sports). They pose significant morbidity, mortality and cost burdens worldwide. Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study show rising incidence, prevalence and YLDs since 1990, with highest rates in older age groups where fragility fractures predominate. Costs are escalating (e.g., a projected 27% increase in fragility fracture costs by 2030 in the largest five EU countries plus Sweden). Early risk assessment and osteoporosis treatment are essential.\n\n**Types:**\nFragility fractures arise from low-energy trauma that would not normally cause fracture, typically due to osteoporosis. Common sites include spine, hip, distal forearm (wrist) and proximal humerus; others include pelvis, ribs and proximal tibia. Hip and vertebral fractures carry the highest seriousness.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- **Modifiable:** smoking, alcohol use, physical inactivity, low body weight, nutrient-poor diets, vitamin D/calcium deficiency, eating disorders, malabsorption, certain medications (glucocorticoids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, androgen deprivation therapy), and falls.\n- **Non-modifiable:** older age, female sex, Caucasian ethnicity, prior fractures, parental fracture history, menopause.\nOsteoporosis—low bone density and microarchitectural deterioration—is itself a major risk factor, increasing bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture.\n\n**Risk prediction:**\nMultiple fracture risk assessment tools combine clinical risk factors (age, sex, prior fractures) with or without bone mineral density (BMD) to estimate five- or ten-year fracture probability and inform treatment decisions. WHO is assessing available tools to recommend models for global use.\n\n**Primary prevention:**\nStrategies focus on maintaining bone density and strength: adequate diet and nutrition, regular exercise/physical activity, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol, treating osteoporosis, and preventing falls. While basic principles are agreed upon, debates continue on specific interventions and treatment duration; WHO is reassessing evidence on prevention measures.\n\n**Treatment and management:**\nEarly detection and treatment (secondary prevention) are crucial—many vertebral fractures remain undiagnosed. Management may be surgical or non-surgical, with orthopaedic care central. Secondary (refracture) prevention and tertiary strategies include rehabilitation and quality-of-life improvement. Timely rehabilitation, assistive products (walking aids, orthoses) and training help individuals recover function.\n\n**Comorbidities:**\nConditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney and liver disease, depression, dementia, and HIV can coexist with fragility fractures, raising risks of post-fracture complications (e.g., infections, stroke) and impairing recovery. Identifying and co-managing comorbidities improves outcomes.\n\n**WHO response:**\n- **Rehabilitation 2030 Initiative:** emphasizes rehabilitation—including fracture care—as a core universal health coverage service; the WHO Package of interventions for rehabilitation outlines essential measures and resources for fractures.\n- **UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030):** fosters global collaboration to improve older adults’ lives; the WHO Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) recommends actions to prevent or slow declines, including fall prevention.\n- **WHO Bone Health and Ageing Initiative (2023):** develops a strategic roadmap to optimize bone health for healthy ageing and advocates public health strategies to prevent fractures among older adults.","category":"Musculoskeletal Conditions","tags":["fragility fractures","osteoporosis","bone health","fall prevention","healthy ageing","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/fragility-fractures","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_108","title":"Helping Your Child with Anger Issues","body":"Anger is a normal, useful emotion that signals when something feels unfair or wrong. It becomes a concern when a child’s angry behaviour turns aggressive or unmanageable. Common triggers include witnessing family conflict, friendship problems, bullying, academic stress, anxiety or fear, and hormonal changes in puberty. Sometimes the cause is unclear, so it’s important to help children explore what might be driving their anger.\n\n**Tackle anger together:**\nWork with your child so they understand anger is the problem—not them. With younger children, naming and drawing anger (e.g., a volcano ready to erupt) can make it manageable. Your reactions influence theirs, so approach anger as a team challenge.\n\n**Spot the signs:**\nHelp your child recognize early physical cues—fast heartbeat, tense muscles, clenched teeth or fists, stomach churning. Noticing these signs enables proactive coping.\n\n**Strategies for your child:**\nIdentify triggers and agree on techniques such as counting to 10, walking away, slow deep breathing, clenching/unclenching fists, talking to a trusted person, or taking time alone to calm down. Point out signs when you notice them, giving your child a chance to use their strategies.\n\n**Encourage active play:**\nRegular physical activity (walks, jogging, running, cycling) can reduce anger and ease stress, anxiety or low mood. Refer to guidance on physical activity for children and young people.\n\n**Be positive:**\nOffer frequent praise for your child’s efforts—and your own—however small. Positive feedback builds confidence in managing anger and reinforces that you’re learning together.\n\n**When to seek help:**\nIf anger harms your child or others, talk to a GP, health visitor or school nurse. A GP may refer to Children and Young People’s Mental Health Services (CYPMHS) for specialist support. In some areas, self-referral is possible. Additional support is available via the YoungMinds parents’ helpline (0808 802 5544, weekdays), YoungMinds resources for parents and young people, and MindEd for Families.\n\n**Key actions:**\n- Explore causes and feelings underlying anger.\n- Collaborate on coping strategies and practice them early.\n- Promote regular activity and positive reinforcement.\n- Seek professional help if anger becomes harmful.\n\nBy responding calmly, modelling constructive coping, and accessing support when needed, parents can help children manage anger and develop healthier emotional skills.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["child mental health","anger management","parenting tips","emotional regulation","NHS guidance"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/children-and-young-adults/advice-for-parents/help-your-child-with-anger-issues/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_109","title":"Abusive Head Trauma","body":"Abusive head trauma (AHT), including shaken baby syndrome, is a severe form of child abuse that causes brain injury and is a leading cause of child abuse deaths in U.S. children under five. It typically occurs when a frustrated caregiver violently shakes or impacts an infant, often in response to persistent crying. This trauma can lead to bleeding around the brain or behind the eyes and results in serious long-term consequences such as vision problems, developmental delays, physical disabilities and hearing loss. About one-third of child maltreatment deaths involve AHT, and up to one in four affected babies dies. Infants under one year are at greatest risk.\n\n**Key facts:**\n- Crying (even inconsolable crying) is normal in infants; shaking, throwing or hitting a baby is never an appropriate response.\n- AHT accounts for a substantial portion of child maltreatment fatalities.\n\n**Prevention:**\nAnyone can help prevent AHT by understanding normal infant crying patterns and supporting parents and caregivers.\n\n**For parents/caregivers:**\n- Try soothing strategies: swaddle, hold skin-to-skin, offer a pacifier, rock, sing or speak softly, take a stroller walk or car ride.\n- If you feel overwhelmed, calm yourself: place the baby safely down and walk away briefly, checking every 5–10 minutes. Reach out to friends, relatives, neighbors, helplines or healthcare providers for help.\n- If crying persists, check for illness and contact the child’s doctor. Never leave the baby with someone who is easily angered, has a temper, or a history of violence.\n- The National Maternal Mental Health Hotline (1-833-852-6262) offers 24/7 confidential support for pregnant and postpartum individuals and their loved ones.\n\n**For friends, family and community members:**\n- Look out for new parents who may need assistance or breaks.\n- Offer to watch the baby so caregivers can rest.\n- Encourage breaks if parents show frustration, ensuring the infant is safely placed in a crib.\n- Provide empathetic support when caregivers are coping with crying.\n- Advocate for workplace policies that allow parents more time with infants during high-crying periods (4–20 weeks of age).\n\nUnderstanding infant crying and providing social support can prevent abusive head trauma and protect infants from life-threatening injuries.","category":"Child Safety","tags":["abusive head trauma","shaken baby syndrome","child abuse prevention","caregiver support","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/child-abuse-neglect/about/about-abusive-head-trauma.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_110","title":"Panic Disorder","body":"Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterised by frequent, unexpected panic attacks and ongoing worry about having more attacks. While occasional anxiety is a natural response to stress, people with panic disorder experience recurring episodes of intense fear or panic without clear triggers and often begin avoiding situations that might provoke attacks, creating a “fear of fear” cycle.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- **Anxiety:** feelings of unease ranging from mild worry to severe fear.\n- **Panic attacks:** sudden rushes of intense mental and physical symptoms such as racing heartbeat, faintness, sweating, nausea, chest pain, shortness of breath, trembling, hot flushes or chills, shaky limbs, choking sensation, dizziness, numbness or pins and needles, dry mouth, dread or fear of dying, churning stomach, tingling fingers, and feelings of detachment. Most attacks last 5–20 minutes (occasionally up to an hour) and, though frightening, are not dangerous. Symptoms may overlap with other conditions, so medical assessment is important.\n\n**When to seek help:**\nSee a GP if you have panic symptoms. Diagnosis typically requires recurrent, unexpected panic attacks plus at least a month of persistent worry about further attacks. Doctors will review symptoms, frequency, duration, and may perform physical exams to exclude other causes.\n\n**Treatment options:**\nAim to reduce attack frequency and severity. Main approaches include:\n- **Talking therapies:** Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps you understand panic responses and learn coping strategies. In England, you can self-refer to talking therapy services or seek GP referral.\n- **Medications:** Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants; if unsuitable, tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine or clomipramine) may be offered. Anti-epileptic medicines such as pregabalin, or clonazepam for severe anxiety, can also be used. Antidepressants may take 2–4 weeks to begin working and up to 8 weeks for full effect. Continue medication unless advised otherwise by your GP.\n- **Specialist referral:** If symptoms persist despite CBT, medication and support groups, your GP may refer you to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist for further assessment and personalised treatment.\n\n**Self-help strategies:**\n- During a panic attack: stay in place if possible, breathe slowly and deeply, remind yourself the episode will pass, focus on calming imagery, and remember it isn’t life-threatening.\n- Preventing future attacks: read CBT-based self-help books, practise relaxation (yoga, pilates), learn breathing techniques, engage in regular physical activity, and avoid triggers such as sugary foods, caffeine, alcohol and smoking.\n\n**Support:**\nConnecting with others who have panic disorder can help. Useful organisations include Anxiety UK, Mind, No Panic, and Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK). Ask your GP about local support groups or mental health services.\n\n**Complications:**\nUntreated panic disorder can escalate, leading to agoraphobia, other phobias, or substance misuse. Inform the DVLA if panic disorder affects your driving ability.\n\n**Causes:**\nExact causes are unclear but may involve traumatic or stressful experiences (e.g., bereavement), family history of panic disorder, or brain chemical imbalances.\n\n**Children:**\nIf a child shows panic disorder symptoms, consult a GP. After medical evaluation, referral to a specialist and CBT may be recommended.\n\nPanic disorder is treatable. Early medical help and a combination of therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and support can significantly improve quality of life.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["panic disorder","panic attacks","anxiety","CBT","NHS guidance"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/panic-disorder/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_111","title":"8 Tips for Healthy Eating","body":"Balancing calorie intake with activity levels and eating a varied diet underpin healthy eating. Adults should aim for roughly 2,500 kcal/day for men and 2,000 kcal/day for women, though many consume more than needed. Following these eight tips supports a balanced diet:\n\n1. **Base meals on higher-fibre starchy carbohydrates:** Starchy foods (potatoes, bread, rice, pasta, cereals) should make up just over one-third of your intake. Opt for wholegrain/higher-fibre versions (wholewheat pasta, brown rice, skin-on potatoes) to stay full longer. Include at least one starchy food per meal and watch added fats (e.g., butter, creamy sauces) to keep calories in check.\n\n2. **Eat lots of fruit and vegetables:** Aim for at least five portions daily (fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced). A portion is 80 g for fresh/canned/frozen, 30 g for dried fruit (best at mealtimes). Limit fruit juice/vegetable juice/smoothies to 150 ml per day due to sugar content.\n\n3. **Eat more fish, including oily fish:** Have at least two portions of fish weekly, with one being oily (salmon, trout, herring, sardines, pilchards, mackerel) for omega-3 fats that may protect heart health. Non-oily options include haddock, plaice, coley, cod, tuna, skate and hake. Fresh, frozen or canned fish all count, but canned/smoked fish can be high in salt, and some species have intake limits.\n\n4. **Cut down on saturated fat and sugar:**\n   - **Saturated fat:** Limit to ≤30 g/day for men and ≤20 g/day for women (less for children; low-fat diets unsuitable under age five). Sources include fatty meats, sausages, butter, hard cheese, cream, cakes, biscuits, lard and pies. Choose unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils, spreads, oily fish and avocados. Use small amounts of vegetable or olive oil instead of butter/ghee, select lean meats, and trim visible fat.\n   - **Sugar:** Reduce free sugars (added sugars and those in honey, syrups, unsweetened juices) found in fizzy drinks, sugary cereals, cakes, biscuits, pastries, sweets, chocolate and alcohol. Excess sugar contributes to weight gain and tooth decay. Check labels: >22.5 g total sugars/100 g is high; ≤5 g is low.\n\n5. **Eat less salt (≤6 g/day for adults):** Excess salt raises blood pressure, increasing heart disease and stroke risk. Around 75% of salt is already in processed foods (cereals, soups, bread, sauces). Use labels—>1.5 g salt/100 g is high. Children should have even less.\n\n6. **Get active and maintain a healthy weight:** Combine healthy eating with regular physical activity to reduce disease risk and support overall wellbeing. Use BMI calculators to assess weight status. For weight loss, eat fewer calories and increase activity; the NHS 12-week weight loss plan offers guidance. See a GP or dietitian if underweight or concerned about weight.\n\n7. **Do not get thirsty:** Drink 6–8 glasses of fluid daily (in addition to fluids from food). Water, lower-fat milk and low-sugar drinks (including tea/coffee) are healthier choices. Limit sugary soft drinks; keep fruit juice/smoothies to ≤150 ml/day. Drink more in hot weather or when exercising.\n\n8. **Do not skip breakfast:** A healthy breakfast that is high in fibre and low in fat, sugar and salt contributes to a balanced diet. Examples include wholegrain, lower-sugar cereals with semi-skimmed milk and fruit. Breakfast helps provide essential nutrients and may prevent overeating later.\n\nEating a variety of foods across these tips ensures the body receives necessary nutrients while supporting weight management and overall health.","category":"Nutrition","tags":["healthy eating","diet","NHS guidance","nutrition tips","balanced diet"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/8-tips-for-healthy-eating/","year":2023}

Units depend on drink size and alcohol strength. Emerging evidence shows stronger links between routine drinking and illnesses, including various cancers, and the idea that moderate alcohol benefits heart health has been downgraded.\n\n**Low-risk drinking guidance:**\n- Men and women should limit intake to 14 units per week if they drink most weeks.\n- Spread drinking over 3 or more days if you consume up to 14 units weekly.\n- Include several alcohol-free days each week to cut down.\n- If pregnant or planning pregnancy, the safest approach is complete abstinence to minimise risk to the baby.\n\n**No safe level:**\nDrinking under 14 units weekly is considered low risk, not “safe,” because no level is risk-free. Regularly exceeding 14 units for 10–20 years increases the likelihood of:\n- Mouth, throat and breast cancers\n- Stroke\n- Heart and liver disease\n- Brain and nervous system damage\nHigh-risk drinking can worsen mental health and is associated with self-harm and suicide. Overall risk rises with higher consumption; the less you drink, the lower the risk. Understanding alcohol units can help you track intake.\n\n**Single-session risks:**\nDrinking too much too quickly on one occasion increases risks of:\n- Accidental injuries or death\n- Poor judgement in dangerous situations\n- Loss of self-control, leading to unprotected sex or violence\nTo stay safer:\n- Limit how much you drink in one session\n- Drink slowly\n- Consume alcohol with food\n- Alternate alcoholic drinks with water or non-alcoholic options\n\nKeeping alcohol intake within recommended limits, moderating single-session drinking, and taking alcohol-free days can significantly reduce health risks.","category":"Public Health","tags":["alcohol","drinking guidelines","NHS","cancer risk","mental health"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_113","title":"5 Steps to Mental Wellbeing","body":"Evidence shows five actions can support mental wellbeing:\n\n1. **Connect with other people:** Strong relationships build belonging, self-worth, opportunities to share positive experiences, and mutual support. Ideas include prioritising family time (e.g., regular dinners), arranging outings with friends, switching off screens to talk or play games, having lunch with a colleague, visiting someone who needs company, volunteering locally, and using video calls to stay in touch. Avoid relying solely on texts or social media to build relationships.\n\n2. **Be physically active:** Activity benefits physical health and boosts mental wellbeing by raising self-esteem, providing goals, and triggering mood-enhancing brain chemistry. Explore exercise guidance (running, aerobic workouts), strength and flexibility routines, or wheelchair-friendly fitness advice. Choose enjoyable activities; you do not need long gym sessions.\n\n3. **Learn new skills:** Learning boosts confidence, self-esteem, purpose and social connection. Options include cooking new recipes, taking on new responsibilities at work (mentoring, presentations), tackling DIY projects, enrolling in college courses (languages, practical skills), or trying new hobbies (blogging, sports, painting). Focus on enjoyable activities rather than formal qualifications unless they interest you.\n\n4. **Give to others:** Acts of giving and kindness foster positive feelings, purpose, self-worth and connection. Examples include thanking someone for their help, genuinely asking about others’ wellbeing, spending time with those who need support, offering practical help on projects, or volunteering in schools, hospitals, or care homes.\n\n5. **Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness):** Awareness of your thoughts, feelings, body and surroundings helps you enjoy life more and better handle challenges. Mindfulness can positively shift your outlook and self-understanding. Practice everyday mindfulness techniques to stay present.\n\nIncorporating these steps regularly can make you feel more positive and help you get the most out of life.","category":"Mental Health","tags":["wellbeing","mental health","mindfulness","self-care","NHS guidance"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/five-steps-to-mental-wellbeing/","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_114","title":"How to Improve Strength and Flexibility","body":"Strength exercises make muscles work harder than usual, increasing strength, size, power and endurance. They typically use body weight or resistance. Aim for at least two muscle-strengthening sessions weekly. Examples include lifting weights, resistance bands, heavy gardening (digging, shovelling), climbing stairs, hill walking, cycling, dancing, push-ups, sit-ups, squats and yoga. Leg-strengthening activities such as tai chi, yoga, dance, stair walking, hiking and weightlifting help maintain strength, balance and coordination, reducing fall risk as you age. A session counts if muscles work to the point you need a brief rest before continuing (e.g., putting down a weight after several reps).\n\nFlexibility exercises improve joint mobility necessary for daily tasks. Activities include stretching, yoga, tai chi and pilates. Maintaining flexibility supports posture, reduces aches, lowers injury risk and helps preserve ability to perform everyday activities.\n\nBenefits of strength and flexibility training include maintaining independence, slowing age-related bone and muscle loss, reducing fall risk, improving posture and lowering injury risk.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, arms) on two or more days per week. Sessions can be under 20 minutes.\n- Perform exercises until completing another repetition without assistance would be difficult.\n- Do 8–12 repetitions per exercise (one set) and aim for at least two sets (three sets for added benefit). Start gradually and build up over weeks.\n- No specific duration is prescribed for flexibility work; integrate stretching or mobility activities regularly.\n\nAerobic exercise: for general health, complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly plus two strength sessions, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity covering both aerobic and strength needs. Time spent on strength exercises does not count towards the 150-minute aerobic goal, though some vigorous aerobic activities (circuit training, dancing, martial arts, football, hockey, rugby) also build strength.\n\nIncorporating varied strength, flexibility and aerobic activities supports full-body fitness, bone health, balance, and resilience across the lifespan.","category":"Fitness","tags":["strength training","flexibility","exercise","NHS guidance","fall prevention"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-improve-strength-flexibility/","year":2022}

It can also worsen ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome. Managing and reducing stress helps maintain digestive balance.\n\n2. **Stop smoking:** Smoking weakens the muscle at the lower end of the oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to flow back (reflux). This causes heartburn and can aggravate ulcers and inflammatory bowel conditions, and increases stomach cancer risk.\n\n3. **Eat properly:** Adopt healthy eating habits: eat slowly and chew well; avoid overeating by reducing portion sizes or having 4–5 smaller meals; eat regularly without skipping meals; avoid large meals within 2–3 hours of bedtime; stay hydrated with plenty of water.\n\n4. **Lose excess weight:** Abdominal fat places pressure on the stomach, triggering heartburn and acid-related symptoms. Weight loss can relieve these complaints. Use BMI calculators to check weight status and follow NHS weight-loss advice if needed.\n\n5. **Avoid binge drinking:** Moderate alcohol intake may not harm digestion, but binge drinking (drinking too much in a single session) increases stomach acid production and can cause heartburn or aggravate other digestive disorders.

After withdrawal, people experience lower anxiety, depression and stress, and higher positive mood—often within six weeks.\n\n**Better for family and friends:**\nStaying healthy lets you support loved ones longer and act as a smoke-free role model (children of smokers are four times more likely to start smoking). Quitting protects others from harmful secondhand smoke, especially children. Financially, the average smoker saves about £49 per week (over £2,500 annually) by quitting.\n\n**Ways to quit:**\n- **Stop-smoking products:** Nicotine replacement and other aids improve success compared to going “cold turkey.”\n- **Support options:** Seek help via online groups, phone services, or face-to-face advisers—support significantly increases the chance of quitting for good.\n\nWhatever your smoking history, quitting delivers rapid and long-term benefits for you and those around you.","category":"Public Health","tags":["smoking cessation","mental health","secondhand smoke","NHS Better Health","disease prevention"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/why-quit-smoking/benefits-of-quitting-smoking/","year":2024}

Dehydration occurs when fluid intake is insufficient and even mild dehydration can cause fatigue. Daily fluid needs vary with health, activity level and environment, but the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids per day for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) for women, including water, other beverages and foods (which typically contribute about 20% of intake). The “eight glasses a day” guideline is reasonable for many people, but needs should be adjusted for exercise (extra fluids before, during and after activity), hot or humid weather, high altitude, illness (fever, vomiting, diarrhea), certain medical conditions (bladder infections, urinary tract stones) and pregnancy or breastfeeding. Hydration can come from water-rich foods (fruits, vegetables) and beverages such as milk, juice and herbal tea; even caffeinated drinks contribute, though sugary beverages should be limited due to excess calories. Adequate hydration is indicated by infrequent thirst and pale urine. To stay hydrated, drink water with each meal and between meals, before/during/after exercise, and whenever thirsty. Drinking too much water is uncommon but can occur, especially in athletes overcompensating; excess intake can dilute blood sodium and cause hyponatremia, which is potentially life-threatening.","category":"Nutrition","tags":["hydration","water intake","fluid needs","dehydration","Mayo Clinic"],"source":"Mayo Clinic","url":"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256","year":2022}

For personalised guidance, consult healthcare professionals or dietitians who consider your health, lifestyle and preferences.\n\n**Healthy diets:**\nChoose eating plans that:\n- Include a variety of foods from major groups: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, lean proteins (beans, legumes, nuts, seeds) and healthy fats.\n- Provide portion guidance for each group.\n- Feature foods available at local grocery stores.\n- Fit your tastes, lifestyle and budget.\nDiscuss specific health risks with your healthcare team (e.g., low-sodium diets for high blood pressure).\n\n**Healthy cooking:**\nMove away from highly processed foods high in calories, sugar, fat and salt. Use techniques like baking, grilling, steaming and sautéing. Focus on food safety, recipe modifications and flavorful approaches that reduce health risks while keeping meals satisfying.\n\n**Healthy menus and shopping strategies:**\nPlan healthier meals by exploring recipes and cookbooks. When shopping, prioritise fresh, frozen and minimally processed foods—spend more time in produce aisles, choose whole grains and low-fat dairy. Limit time in snack and candy aisles, and visit farmers markets for seasonal produce.\n\n**Nutritional supplements:**\nSupplements complement but do not replace a balanced diet. Most healthy people who eat varied foods may not need them. They can help in situations such as pregnancy (prenatal vitamins with folic acid), limited diets, allergies, intolerances, or medical conditions that restrict certain foods.

{"id":"DOC_120","title":"Tobacco","body":"**Key facts:** Tobacco kills up to half of its users who don’t quit. More than 7 million people die annually from tobacco, including 1.6 million non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. About 80% of 1.3 billion tobacco users live in low- and middle-income countries. WHO Member States adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2003; 183 countries are Parties. WHO MPOWER measures align with the FCTC and reduce deaths and costs.\n\n**Overview:** The tobacco epidemic is a major public health threat causing over 7 million deaths yearly plus long-term illness. All forms of tobacco are harmful with no safe exposure level. Cigarettes are most common; other products include waterpipe tobacco, cigars, cigarillos, heated tobacco, roll-your-own, pipe tobacco, bidis, kreteks and smokeless products. 80% of users live in low- and middle-income countries where illness and death are greatest. Tobacco use drives poverty by diverting spending from basic needs and is difficult to curb due to addiction. Economic costs include healthcare spending and lost productivity.\n\n**Key measures to reduce demand:**\n- **Surveillance:** Monitoring tobacco use helps tailor policies; nearly half the global population is surveyed through national representative studies.\n- **Second-hand smoke kills:** There's no safe level. It causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer, killing ~1.6 million people annually. Over one-third of the population in 79 countries is protected by smoke-free laws.\n- **Tobacco users need help to quit:** Counselling and medications can more than double quitting success. Comprehensive cessation services with cost coverage exist in only 31 countries covering one-third of the global population.\n- **Pictorial health warnings work:** Graphic warnings and mass media campaigns prevent uptake and encourage quitting. 62% of the world’s population lives in 110 countries with best-practice warnings (≥50% of packaging, national language, rotating). 2.9 billion people live in 36 countries that ran strong anti-tobacco campaigns in the last 2 years.\n- **Bans on tobacco advertising lower consumption:** TAPS recruit new users and deter quitting. 68 countries, over a quarter of the world’s population, have complete TAPS bans.\n- **Taxes are effective:** Raising tobacco taxes is cost-effective, reducing consumption especially in youth and low-income groups. A 10% price increase cuts consumption ~4% in high-income and ~5% in low- and middle-income countries. Only 41 countries (12% of the population) tax tobacco at ≥75% of retail price.\n- **Illicit trade must be stopped:** One in ten tobacco products is illicit, undermining health, economic and security goals. Many countries show illicit trade can be curbed even with higher taxes. The WHO FCTC Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade (ITP) provides key supply-side controls.\n\n**Newer nicotine and tobacco products:**\n- **Heated tobacco products (HTPs):** Produce aerosols with nicotine and toxic chemicals via heating. Despite risk-reduction claims, evidence doesn’t show they’re safer than conventional tobacco. Some toxicants are lower; others (e.g., glycidol, pyridine, dimethyl trisulfide, acetoin, methylglyoxal) may be higher. Some toxicants unique to HTPs have uncertain health impacts; some are carcinogens.\n- **Electronic cigarettes (ENDS/ENNDS):** Include e-cigars, e-pipes; emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances harmful to users and bystanders. Products claiming nicotine-free may still contain nicotine. Long-term impacts remain unclear, but evidence shows harm, including increased risk of heart disease and lung disorders. Nicotine exposure in pregnancy harms the fetus and affects brain development.\n- **Nicotine pouches:** Pre-portioned pouches similar to snus, used between gum and lip, often marketed as “tobacco-free” or “white pouches.”\n\n**WHO response:** There is a fundamental conflict between the tobacco industry and public health. The industry promotes addictive, deadly products causing societal harms, including poverty. The WHO FCTC is an evidence-based treaty affirming the right to health and providing legal frameworks for international cooperation, with 182 Parties covering >90% of the world’s population. In 2007, WHO launched MPOWER to scale up demand-reduction provisions. MPOWER measures: Monitor tobacco use and policies; Protect people from tobacco use; Offer help to quit; Warn about dangers; Enforce advertising bans; Raise taxes.

{"id":"DOC_121","title":"Rehabilitation","body":"**Key facts**\n- Rehabilitation is an essential part of universal health coverage along with promotion of good health, prevention of disease, treatment and palliative care.\n- Rehabilitation helps a child, adult or older person to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and enables participation in education, work, recreation and meaningful life roles such as taking care of family.\n- Globally, an estimated 2.4 billion people are currently living with a health condition that may benefit from rehabilitation.\n- The need for rehabilitation worldwide is predicted to increase due to changes in the health and characteristics of the population. For example, people are living longer, but with more chronic disease and disability.\n- Currently, the need for rehabilitation is largely unmet. In some low- and middle-income countries, more than 50% of people do not receive the rehabilitation services they require. Emergencies including conflicts, disasters and outbreaks create enormous surges in rehabilitation needs while also disrupting rehabilitation services.\n- Rehabilitation is an important part of universal health coverage and is a key strategy for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 – “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”.\n\n**Overview**\nRehabilitation is defined as “a set of interventions designed to optimize functioning and reduce disability in individuals with health conditions in interaction with their environment”. Rehabilitation helps people to be as independent as possible in everyday activities and to participate in education, work, recreation and family life. It addresses underlying conditions and symptoms, adapts environments, involves assistive products, supports self-management and modifies tasks to improve safety and independence. Rehabilitation can help with difficulties related to thinking, seeing, hearing, communicating, eating or moving. Anyone may need rehabilitation at some point due to injury, surgery, disease, illness or age-related decline.\n\nExamples include speech and language training after brain injury; physical exercise training for stroke or Parkinson disease; modifying home environments for older adults; educating people with heart disease about safe exercise; preparing a person with an amputation for prosthetic use; positioning and splinting after burns; prescribing medicine to reduce spasticity in cerebral palsy; psychological therapies after spinal cord injury; social skills training for schizophrenia or autism; training individuals with vision loss to use a white cane; and working with intensive care patients to improve breathing and recovery.\n\nRehabilitation is person-centred, tailored to individual goals and preferences, and can be provided in inpatient or outpatient hospitals, physiotherapy or occupational therapy practices, community settings, homes, schools or workplaces. The workforce includes physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, audiologists, orthotists, prosthetists, clinical psychologists, physical medicine and rehabilitation doctors, rehabilitation nurses and other health workers such as general practitioners, surgeons and community health workers.\n\n**Benefits of rehabilitation**\nRehabilitation reduces the impact of many health conditions, complements medical and surgical interventions, facilitates recovery and prevents complications. It minimizes or slows disability in chronic conditions (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes) by providing self-management strategies, assistive products and pain control. It supports healthy ageing. Rehabilitation is cost-effective, helping to avoid hospitalization, shorten stays, prevent re-admissions and enable work or independence, thereby reducing financial and caregiver burdens. Rehabilitation is essential for universal health coverage and achieving SDG 3.\n\n**Misconceptions**\nRehabilitation is not only for people with disabilities or long-term physical impairments; it is an essential health service for anyone with a condition or injury limiting function. It is not a luxury; timely, high-quality, affordable rehabilitation should be available to all and integrated early with other health interventions.\n\n**Unmet global need**\nAbout 2.4 billion people could benefit from rehabilitation, and demand is growing due to ageing populations, chronic diseases, injuries and developmental conditions. In many regions, especially low- and middle-income countries, more than half of those needing rehabilitation do not receive it. Barriers include lack of prioritization, funding, policies, services outside urban areas, long waiting times, high out-of-pocket costs, insufficient trained professionals (often fewer than 10 per million population), limited resources (assistive technology, equipment), insufficient research and data, and weak referral pathways.\n\n**Rehabilitation in emergencies**\nDisasters, conflicts, outbreaks and other hazards create surges in rehabilitation needs and disrupt services, particularly affecting vulnerable populations and weak health systems. Although rehabilitation’s role is recognized in guidelines, it is rarely included in preparedness and early response, leading to magnified service limitations, less efficient health delivery and increased impairment risks.\n\n**WHO response**\nStrengthening health systems is essential to ensure rehabilitation services are available at all levels, including primary care, and integrated into universal health coverage. WHO’s work is guided by the World Health Assembly resolution on strengthening rehabilitation in health systems and implemented through the Rehabilitation 2030 initiative. WHO supports Member States in areas such as leadership and governance, financing, health information systems, service delivery, workforce, research and evidence, and emergency preparedness. Tools and resources include policy briefs, rehabilitation packages, competency frameworks, workforce evaluation guides, the Rehabilitation Need Estimator, and standards for emergencies. WHO also promotes advocacy through the World Rehabilitation Alliance.","category":"Public Health","tags":["rehabilitation","universal health coverage","rehabilitation workforce","WHO","Rehabilitation 2030"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rehabilitation","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_122","title":"Heat and health","body":"\n\n**Key facts**\n- Heat is a major environmental and occupational health hazard. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and can worsen cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health conditions, asthma, and the risk of accidents and some infectious diseases. Heatstroke is a medical emergency with a high case-fatality rate.\n- The number of people exposed to extreme heat is rising exponentially in every world region due to climate change. Heat-related mortality among people over 65 years increased by about 85% between 2000–2004 and 2017–2021 (1).\n- Between 2000–2019, studies estimate about 489 000 heat-related deaths each year, with 45% occurring in Asia and 36% in Europe (2). Europe recorded an estimated 61 672 heat-related excess deaths in the summer of 2022 (3). Past high-intensity events caused severe mortality, including 70 000 deaths in Europe during June–August 2003 and 56 000 excess deaths during a 44-day heatwave in the Russian Federation in 2010.\n- Vulnerability to heat depends on physiological factors (age, health status) and exposure factors (occupation, socio-economic conditions).\n- Heat impacts are predictable and largely preventable through targeted public health and multisectoral policies and interventions. WHO guidance supports institutions in identifying and managing extreme heat risks. Climate action combined with preparedness and risk management can save lives now and in the future.\n\n**Overview**\nA heatwave is a period when local excess heat builds over several unusually hot days and nights. Heatwaves and prolonged excess heat are becoming more frequent, longer, and more intense because of climate change. Even low or moderate events can harm vulnerable populations. Extended periods of high day and nighttime temperatures generate cumulative stress on the human body, raising illness and mortality risks. Heatwaves can affect large populations quickly, trigger public health emergencies, cause excess mortality, and create socioeconomic impacts such as lost work capacity and productivity. Power shortages during heat can disrupt health facilities, transport, and water infrastructure, reducing health service delivery.\n\nPopulation ageing and the rising prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (respiratory, cardiovascular, diabetes, dementia, renal, musculoskeletal) heighten susceptibility to heat. Urban design deficiencies—loss of greenspace, heat-amplifying materials like metal roofs—further increase exposure. Awareness of heat risks remains insufficient among health workers and the public, underscoring the need to adjust guidance, planning, and interventions and to manage sharp increases in admissions during heatwaves. Practical, feasible, often low-cost measures across individual, community, organizational, governmental, and societal levels can save lives.\n\n**Who is affected?**\nPopulations in tropical and subtropical climates are chronically exposed to high temperatures, while exposure in mid to high latitudes is seasonal. Adult vulnerabilities tied to physiological or clinical factors are well documented (4). Heat affects health via multiple direct and indirect mechanisms, although evidence on chronic exposure to persistent high temperatures and humidity is limited.\n\nOutdoor and manual workers, athletes, and civil protection personnel are at risk of exertional heat stress due to their work. Urban and rural poor often face overheating because of low-quality housing and limited cooling access; informal settlements can be hotter than other urban areas. Gender roles may influence exposure, such as women cooking indoors during hot weather.\n\n**How does heat impact health?**\nHeat retained in the body depends on an inability to dissipate metabolically generated heat under environmental stress (high temperature, humidity, low wind, high thermal radiation), clothing that blocks heat loss, and external heat gain. When thermoregulation fails, the risks of heat exhaustion and heatstroke rise, and the body’s cooling effort stresses the heart and kidneys. Heat extremes exacerbate chronic conditions (cardiovascular, mental, respiratory, diabetes) and can cause acute kidney injury.\n\nHeat-related deaths and hospitalizations occur rapidly, often the same day or shortly after a heat event, so interventions must be swift once a heat alert is issued. Heat can disrupt essential services through power or transport outages, decrease productivity, increase accident risk, hinder work or learning, and even close schools or institutions. Heatwaves may coincide with hazardous air pollution. The health impact scale depends on the timing, intensity, and duration of events and the acclimatization and adaptability of local populations, infrastructure, and institutions.\n\n**What actions should the public take?**\n\n*Stay out of the heat*\n- Avoid outdoor and strenuous activity during the hottest part of the day.\n- Stay in the shade; perceived temperatures in direct sun may be 10–15 °C higher.\n- Spend 2–3 hours daily in a cool place.\n- Never swim alone and be mindful of drowning risks.\n- Monitor official heat warnings.\n\n*Keep your home cool*\n- Use night air to cool the home by opening windows when outdoor temperatures drop below indoor levels.\n- During hotter daytime periods, keep windows closed and shaded with blinds or shutters, and switch off unnecessary electrical devices.\n- Use electric fans only when temperatures are below 40 °C / 104 °F; above this threshold they heat the body.\n- If using air conditioning, set the thermostat to 27 °C / 81 °F and run an electric fan to feel roughly 4 °C cooler while saving up to 70% on cooling costs.\n- Remember shaded outdoor areas may be cooler than indoors.\n\n*Keep your body cool and hydrated*\n- Wear light, loose-fitting clothing and bedding.\n- Take cool showers or baths.\n- Cool skin with damp cloths, sprays, or wet light clothing.\n- Drink water regularly (about one cup per hour and at least 2–3 litres daily).\n- Check frequently on vulnerable people, especially those over 65, individuals with heart, lung, or kidney conditions, people with disabilities, and those living alone.\n\n*Protect infants and children*\n- Never leave children or animals in parked vehicles; temperatures rise dangerously fast.\n- Avoid direct sun during peak hours by seeking shade or staying indoors; shade can reduce perceived heat by more than 10 °C.\n- Do not cover strollers or prams with dry fabric; use a wet, thin cloth and re-wet to lower temperatures, and pair with a portable fan for added cooling.\n- Dress children in lightweight, loose-fitting, skin-covering clothing and use wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen.\n- Follow home-cooling guidance to maintain safe indoor conditions.\n\n**WHO response**\nMitigating climate change via rapid greenhouse gas reductions is crucial to limit extreme heat’s human costs. Through the Alliance for Transformational Change in Climate and Health (ATACH) and technical and policy support, WHO helps countries adapt health sectors and communities to climate risks. WHO collaborates with health authorities to strengthen governance, preparedness, and response to heatwaves by creating heat action plans, early warning systems, advisories, and emergency response plans that map risks, vulnerable groups, capacities, and resources. These plans protect high-risk settings such as health facilities, nursing homes, and schools lacking cooling.\n\nWHO co-sponsors the Global Heat Health Information Network to accelerate knowledge-sharing on extreme heat risks and solutions and works closely with the World Meteorological Organization to develop Heat Health Warning Systems.","category":"Climate and Health","tags":["extreme heat","climate change","public health","heatwaves","WHO guidance"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_123","title":"Micronutrient Facts","body":"Published: 10 March 2025\n\n**What to know**\nMicronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are essential for healthy development, growth, disease prevention, and overall well-being. Six priority micronutrients—iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, iodine, folate, and zinc—demonstrate how small daily amounts deliver critical health benefits.\n\n**Overview**\nWith the exception of vitamin D, micronutrients are not produced in the body and must come from the diet (1). Although required in small quantities, adequate intake prevents severe consequences. At least half of children under five worldwide experience vitamin and mineral deficiencies (2). WHO recommends multiple nutrition interventions to close these gaps (3).\n\n**Iron**\n- Supports motor development and fetal and childhood brain growth; children and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to deficiency (3).\n- Iron deficiency is a leading cause of anemia, defined by low hemoglobin; globally it affects 40% of children under five and 30% of pregnant women (4).\n- Anemia in pregnancy raises the risk of maternal and neonatal death (2.5–3.4 million deaths annually) and increases poor fetal growth, preterm birth, and low birth weight (5).\n- Infant iron needs differ based on feeding (exclusive breast milk, formula, or mixed feeding); deficiency also limits physical productivity and work capacity.\n\n**Vitamin A**\n- Essential for healthy eyesight and immune defense; deficiency heightens risks of blindness and fatal infections such as measles and diarrhea (6).\n- Approximately 190 million preschool-age children worldwide are deficient (6).\n- Providing vitamin A supplements for children 6 months to under 5 years reduces deaths linked to deficiency (6).\n\n**Vitamin D**\n- Synthesized from sunlight, though production varies by geography, skin pigmentation, air pollution, and the need to avoid excessive sun that raises skin cancer risk.\n- All children require vitamin D shortly after birth.\n- Enables immune defenses against bacteria and viruses, supports muscle and nerve function, and helps the body absorb calcium to build strong bones and protect older adults from osteoporosis (7).\n- Deficiency drives rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults, and evidence suggests widespread global deficiency (8).\n\n**Iodine**\n- Critical during pregnancy and infancy for growth and cognitive development (9).\n- Dietary iodine is generally low; around 1.8 billion people have insufficient intake.\n- Fortifying salt with iodine effectively increases intake; about 86% of households use iodized salt, and fortification levels can be adjusted so people still meet needs when eating less salt (10, 11).\n- Pregnant and breastfeeding women should take 150 micrograms of iodine daily, starting at least three months before pregnancy if planning to conceive (12, 13).\n\n**Folate (Vitamin B9)**\n- Needed to create new cells daily and is crucial before and during pregnancy for early fetal brain and spine development (14).\n- Women of reproductive age require 400 micrograms of folic acid each day (14).\n- Ensuring adequate folate before pregnancy lowers neural tube defects such as spina bifida and anencephaly and reduces neonatal deaths (14, 15).\n- Supplements and fortification of staples like wheat flour help women aged 15–49 meet requirements.\n\n**Zinc**\n- Promotes immune function and resistance to infections, including diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria, and is necessary for healthy pregnancies (16–18).\n- About 17.3% of the global population—and up to 30% in some regions—is at risk for zinc deficiency because of dietary inadequacy (19).\n- Zinc supplementation reduces premature births, decreases childhood diarrhea and respiratory infections, lowers all-cause mortality, and improves growth and weight gain in infants and young children (19).\n- Preventive zinc supplementation for children under five is highly cost-effective in low- and middle-income countries (20, 21).\n\n**Resources**\n- Additional fact sheets are available for each micronutrient in English and Spanish.","category":"Nutrition","tags":["micronutrients","vitamins","minerals","nutrition","public health"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/features/micronutrient-facts.html#cdc_generic_section_4-vitamin-d","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_124","title":"Social anxiety (social phobia)","body":"Page last reviewed: 17 May 2023\n\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia) is a long-term and overwhelming fear of social situations. It usually begins in the teenage years, can cause significant distress, and may persist without treatment, although some people improve with age. Getting help is important because effective treatments are available.\n\n**Symptoms of social anxiety**\nSocial anxiety is more than shyness; the fear does not go away and affects daily activities, self-confidence, relationships, work, or school. Warning signs include:\n- Persistent worry about everyday activities such as meeting strangers, starting conversations, using the phone, working, or shopping.\n- Avoiding or feeling intense anxiety about social activities like group conversations, eating with others, or attending parties.\n- Constant fear of embarrassment (for example, blushing, sweating, or seeming incompetent).\n- Difficulty performing tasks when watched, feeling judged continuously, or fearing criticism.\n- Avoiding eye contact, feeling low self-esteem, or experiencing physical symptoms such as nausea, sweating, trembling, or heart palpitations.\n- Panic attacks marked by overwhelming fear lasting a few minutes.\nPeople with social anxiety often have additional conditions, including depression, generalized anxiety disorder, or panic disorder.\n\n**When to seek help**\nConsult a GP if social anxiety significantly affects life. GPs understand how common the condition is and can help put you at ease. They will ask about feelings, behaviors, and symptoms in social situations. If social anxiety is suspected, you may be referred to a mental health specialist for assessment and treatment planning. You can also self-refer to an NHS talking therapies service without a GP referral.\n\n**Self-help approaches**\n- Explore your anxiety by noting thoughts and behaviors in specific situations; keeping a diary can clarify patterns.\n- Practice relaxation strategies, such as breathing exercises for stress.\n- Break challenging situations into smaller steps, building confidence gradually.\n- Focus on what others are saying instead of assuming worst-case scenarios.\nAdditional resources include NHS information on anxiety, fear, and panic, as well as NHS self-help guides for social anxiety. An NHS audio guide (last reviewed 5 April 2025) offers relaxation techniques and tips for taking control of anxiety.\n\n**Treatments for social anxiety**\nAvailable options include:\n- Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) delivered individually, in groups, or with parents/carers to identify and change negative thoughts and behaviours.\n- Guided self-help that uses CBT-based workbooks or online courses supported by a therapist.\n- Antidepressant medicines, typically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like escitalopram or sertraline (generally not used for children and young people).\nCBT is usually the first-line treatment, but combinations or alternative options may be needed if it is ineffective or unsuitable.\n\n**Support groups**\nCharities and online forums provide community support, including Anxiety UK, the HealthUnlocked anxiety forum run by Anxiety Support, Mind, YoungMinds, and Triumph Over Phobia (TOP UK).\n\n**Social anxiety in children**\nChildren can also experience social anxiety. Indicators include frequent crying or distress, anger, avoiding interactions, fear of school or group activities, reluctance to seek help, and heavy reliance on parents or carers. Speak to a GP if concerned. Treatments resemble those for teens and adults, though medication is rarely used. Therapy is adapted to the child’s age, often involves parental participation, may include self-help materials, and can occur in small groups.\n\n**Talking therapies video**\nAn NHS animated video explains how to self-refer to talking therapies for stress, anxiety, or depression, with options for British Sign Language and audio description (last reviewed 14 March 2022).\n","category":"Mental Health","tags":["social anxiety","anxiety disorders","CBT","self-help","mental health"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/social-anxiety/","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_125","title":"How to keep your teeth clean","body":"Page last reviewed: 30 June 2025\n\nBrush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day for about 2 minutes to keep teeth and gums healthy. Plaque is a bacterial film that forms when brushing is inadequate, contributing to gum disease and tooth decay. Thorough brushing prevents plaque buildup and should cover every surface of each tooth.\n\n**When should I brush my teeth?**\nBrush twice daily for roughly 2 minutes, including last thing at night and once more during the day. Dental professionals may tailor advice for individual needs.\n\n**Should I use an electric or manual toothbrush?**\nBoth electric and manual brushes work equally well when all surfaces are cleaned using fluoride toothpaste. Some people find electric brushes easier for thorough cleaning.\n\n**What should I look for in a toothbrush?**\nMost adults do well with a small-headed brush featuring a compact, angled mix of long and short round-end bristles. Medium or soft bristles suit most people. Consistent twice-daily brushing matters more than the brush type. Consult a dental professional if unsure.\n\n**What type of toothpaste should I use?**\nUse toothpaste with appropriate fluoride levels and check the label for concentration.\n- Adults: at least 1,350 ppm fluoride.\n- Children: family toothpaste containing 1,350–1,500 ppm fluoride works for all ages; those 3 and under without decay may use at least 1,000 ppm fluoride.\n- Under 3s: use a smear of toothpaste. Ages 3–6: use a pea-sized amount and prevent children from licking or eating toothpaste from the tube.\nDentists may recommend higher-strength fluoride toothpaste if necessary.\n\n**How to brush your teeth**\nCover inside, outside, and chewing surfaces, taking about 2 minutes to clean all teeth.\n\n**How to help children brush their teeth**\nSupervise or assist children brushing until at least age 7. Seek further guidance on caring for children’s teeth if needed.\n\n**Don’t rinse with water straight after toothbrushing**\nAfter brushing, spit excess toothpaste out but avoid rinsing immediately to keep concentrated fluoride on teeth. Rinsing dilutes fluoride and reduces prevention benefits.\n\n**How to use dental floss**\nFlossing prevents more than food impaction; it removes plaque along the gum line, reducing gum disease, decay, and bad breath. Floss before brushing.\n1. Take 30–45 cm of floss or dental tape, leaving 3–4 cm taut between hands.\n2. Slide between teeth, reaching the gum line.\n3. Curve into a C-shape and gently move up and down each tooth to remove plaque and debris.\n\n**How to use interdental brushes**\nInterdental or single-tufted brushes can replace flossing, especially where gaps exist. Brushes should fit snugly between teeth. Avoid wooden toothpicks, which can damage gums and lead to infection. Ask a dentist or hygienist for personalised guidance.\n\n**Should I use mouthwash?**\nFluoride mouthwash helps prevent decay, but do not use it immediately after brushing because it washes away concentrated fluoride from toothpaste. Use mouthwash at a different time (for example, after lunch) and avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes afterward.\n","category":"Oral Health","tags":["oral hygiene","fluoride","tooth brushing","dental floss","mouthwash"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-teeth-and-gums/how-to-keep-your-teeth-clean/","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_126","title":"Body Clocks","body":"**Overview:**\nThe body has an internal network of biological clocks that governs daily circadian rhythms—patterns in sleep, alertness, appetite, and other key functions. A master clock in the brain receives signals from the eyes and coordinates clocks throughout the body. Daylight cues prompt hormone releases that boost alertness and energy, while evening darkness triggers melatonin production for sleep. Keeping these rhythms synchronized is vital for health.\n\n**How rhythms work:**\nCircadian rhythms, driven by clock genes, influence body temperature, blood pressure, activity levels, inflammation, fertility, mood, and brain function. Timing of health events can align with these rhythms; for example, heart attacks occur more often in early morning when cortisol rises.\n\n**Metabolism and timing:**\nCircadian rhythms affect eating habits, digestion, and metabolism. Eating later in the day—close to melatonin release—can disrupt rhythms, leading to increased body fat and higher risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Time of day also affects how well medications work and their side effects, including cancer therapies.\n\n**Disruptors:**\nModern lifestyles can desynchronize internal clocks:\n- **Shift work:** Working at night conflicts with natural rhythms, causing fatigue at work, daytime sleep difficulty, and higher risks of heart disease, digestive issues, cancer, and depression.\n- **Jet lag:** Crossing time zones causes misalignment because the brain struggles to adapt rapidly to new day-night cycles.\n- **Around-the-clock schedules:** Light exposure, irregular meals, and varied sleep patterns challenge circadian alignment.\n\n**Research and future directions:**\nScientists investigate optimal timing for treatments, surgeries, and behaviors to align with body clocks. This work may lead to improved strategies for managing insomnia, jet lag, diabetes, and other rhythm-related disorders.\n\n**Wise choices to keep clocks on track:**\n- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule every day.\n- Sleep in a dark, quiet, comfortable environment.\n- Avoid heavy meals two to three hours before bedtime.\n- Limit caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol late in the day.\n- Exercise daily, but finish at least two hours before bedtime.\n- Reduce exposure to bright screens before sleep.\n\nProtecting circadian rhythms through sleep hygiene, light management, and regular routines supports overall health and reduces risks tied to clock disruption.","category":"Healthy Living","tags":["circadian rhythm","body clocks","sleep","metabolism","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/04/tick-tock-your-body-clocks","year":2018}

{"id":"DOC_127","title":"Hydrating for Health","body":"**Overview:**\nRoughly two-thirds of body weight is water, making fluids essential for cellular function, bodily fluids (saliva, blood, urine, sweat, joint fluid), and overall survival. Water loss occurs through sweat, bathroom use, and breathing, so daily intake must replace losses to avoid dehydration.\n\n**Dehydration signs and risks:**\nEarly warnings include intense thirst, headaches, dry mouth or skin, and dark urine. Severe dehydration can cause confusion, fainting, inability to urinate, and rapid heartbeat and breathing—situations requiring urgent medical care and possibly intravenous fluids.\n\n**Long-term health impact:**\nNIH research links chronic underhydration in middle age to higher risks of heart failure, diabetes, chronic lung disease, dementia, faster aging, and earlier death. Staying well hydrated may support healthier aging.\n\n**Daily fluid guidance:**\nWater and low-calorie drinks (plain coffee or tea, sparkling or flavored water, milk or alternatives, 100% vegetable juice) are preferred sources. Sugary sodas or sports drinks add calories with limited value. Needs vary by age, location, and body weight, and increase with exercise, hot weather, illness, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or medications that increase urination. Experts suggest about 9 cups of fluids daily for women and 13 cups for men on average.\n\n**Personal strategies:**\nNIH researcher Dr. Natalia Dmitrieva now carries a liter of water to work daily to ensure adequate intake—a simple tactic anyone can adopt.\n\n**Wise Choices: Staying hydrated:**\n- Drink when thirsty—and proactively during the day\n- Choose water or low-calorie beverages; carry a refillable bottle\n- Drink at routine times (with meals) and around physical activity\n- Increase fluids during hot weather or illness\n- Seek medical help for confusion, fainting, rapid heartbeat or breathing, or inability to urinate\n\nMaintaining regular fluid intake supports organ function, limits dehydration risks, and may reduce the likelihood of chronic disease and premature aging.","category":"Healthy Living","tags":["hydration","water intake","dehydration","healthy aging","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2023/05/hydrating-health","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_128","title":"Minding Your Metabolism","body":"**Overview:**\nMetabolism—the chemical processes that create energy and substances for growth and health—slows with age. People often notice less muscle, lower energy, and more body fat beginning in their 30s and beyond. Without diet and activity adjustments, gradual gains can turn middle-age spread into middle-age sprawl, increasing disease risk.\n\n**Why metabolism shifts:**\nAging reduces calorie burn, alters nutrient breakdown, and causes lean muscle loss. Sedentary habits and overeating accelerate these changes. Leptin, a hormone that signals fullness, becomes less effective with age and obesity, leaving people hungry even after eating. Food also stimulates brain reward pathways; over time, larger portions may be needed to get the same satisfaction. Aging and obesity impair glucose processing, raising diabetes risk—and with it, heart disease, blindness, amputations, and other complications. Long-standing diabetes and obesity may even change brain cells, making them more vulnerable to aging.\n\n**Nutrition through the decades:**\nAfter age 50, most people need fewer calories but must still prioritize nutrient-dense foods. Both under- and overweight status harm health in later life. NIH’s “What’s on Your Plate? Smart Food Choices for Healthy Aging” provides guidance.\n\n**Role of physical activity:**\nRegular movement at any age helps preserve muscle, boost metabolism, and limit abdominal fat. Consult healthcare providers about safe workout plans, especially if managing conditions such as arthritis or recovering from surgery. NIH’s Go4Life campaign offers older adults tips on starting routines, planning, and setting goals.\n\n**Wise Choices: Small steps to healthy aging:**\n- Commit to a healthy diet and limit snacking\n- Drink plenty of water\n- Move more—take stairs, add walking breaks, avoid extended sitting\n- Get adequate sleep\n- Limit alcohol, which is high in calories and can worsen age-related conditions\n- Avoid tobacco products\n\nStaying active and eating well are powerful tools to counter metabolic slowdowns, maintain strength, and reduce the health risks tied to middle-age weight gain.","category":"Healthy Aging","tags":["metabolism","middle-age spread","healthy aging","nutrition","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2015/07/minding-your-metabolism","year":2015}

{"id":"DOC_129","title":"Maintain Your Muscle","body":"**Overview:**\nExercise isn’t limited to running or cycling. Beyond endurance workouts, flexibility, balance, and strength training each play a vital role in long-term health. Stretching improves range of motion, balance work reduces fall risk as people age, and strength (resistance) training keeps muscles functional at every life stage without necessarily building bulky muscles.\n\n**Why strength training matters:**\n- Builds muscle strength so daily and recreational activities remain possible\n- Helps maintain bone health\n- Improves how the body processes food, lowering diabetes risk\n- Associates with reduced cardiovascular and chronic disease risk\n- Directly strengthens muscle cells, a benefit unique to resistance work\n\nExperts recommend muscle-strengthening activities at least three times weekly for children and teens, and 2+ days a week targeting major muscle groups for adults. Benefits grow with age because preventing muscle loss supports independence, enabling tasks such as rising from chairs or climbing stairs. Research shows older adults with walking difficulty improved daily function after a three-month weight-lifting program, while stretching alone didn’t yield similar strength gains.\n\n**Mind and body connections:**\nStrength training may ease anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. Mechanisms under study include reductions in stress hormones, improved self-esteem, and increased sense of control. Offering enjoyable, nontraditional exercise options may engage people who hesitate to pursue counseling or aerobic programs.\n\n**Getting started:**\n- Consider a few sessions with a personal trainer to learn proper technique\n- Access low- or no-cost classes at gyms, recreation centers, senior centers, or community centers\n- Choose enjoyable formats—group classes or solo routines—to maintain consistency\n- Consult healthcare providers before launching home programs, especially for beginners or those with health conditions\n\n**Wise Choices: Lifting weights safely**\n- Start slowly, particularly if inactive, and gradually increase intensity\n- Watch for exhaustion, joint soreness, or muscle pain as signs of overdoing it\n- Begin with light weights, focus on form, and add resistance over time\n- Use smooth, steady motions; avoid jerking weights and locking joints\n- Breathe throughout—exhale during lifts, inhale during relaxation\n- Seek guidance from trainers or group classes when needed\n\nTailored strength training preserves mobility, supports mental health, and complements endurance, balance, and flexibility activities for comprehensive fitness at any age.","category":"Healthy Living","tags":["strength training","resistance exercise","healthy aging","mental health","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2020/03/maintain-your-muscle","year":2020}

{"id":"DOC_130","title":"Keeping Your Gut in Check","body":"**Overview:**\nThe gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a 30-foot muscular tube that breaks food into nutrients and fuels cells throughout the body. With such a complex system, digestive disorders are common: 60–70 million Americans experience conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), along with widespread issues such as bloating and stomach pain. Genetics, anatomy, diet, stress, and lifestyle all influence gut health.\n\n**Lifestyle foundations:**\nRoutine schedules, balanced diets with smaller frequent meals, regular exercise, and sufficient sleep help manage many GI issues. Stress management is critical, especially for IBS. Research shows early life stress raises IBS risk, but confiding in trusted people and managing stress can lessen symptoms.\n\n**Fiber and diet:**\nGradually increasing fiber (aim for 20–30 grams daily) supports constipation relief. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts at every meal. Some fiber-rich foods—high FODMAP items such as certain fruits, vegetables, dairy, and wheat/rye products—can worsen IBS symptoms; healthcare providers may recommend low-FODMAP diets when appropriate.\n\n**Gut microbes and immune ties:**\nThe gut microbiota aids digestion and may influence obesity, type 2 diabetes, IBS, colon cancer, allergies, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. Probiotics (live microbes in supplements or foods like yogurt) may prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea or ease IBS symptoms, but optimal strains, doses, and patient profiles remain unclear. Emulsifiers in processed foods can disrupt gut flora and promote inflammation; minimizing highly processed foods supports gut balance.\n\n**Partnership with providers:**\nEffective GI care requires collaboration. Engage physicians who listen to your history and work with you to tailor routines that foster gut health.\n\n**Wise Choices for gut health:**\n- Eat slowly and chew thoroughly to reduce swallowed air and better gauge fullness\n- Enjoy smaller meals to avoid overfilling the stomach and triggering reflux\n- Limit late-night eating; GI activity is highest earlier in the day\n- Manage stress through mindfulness, relaxation breathing, exercise, and routines\n- Eat on a schedule to help the GI system perform consistently\n- Discuss probiotics with your doctor if considering supplements to ease constipation or IBS\n\nBalanced diets, stress control, and consistent routines, combined with clinician guidance, help keep the digestive system on track.","category":"Digestive Health","tags":["gut health","digestive system","IBS","fiber","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2017/05/keeping-your-gut-check","year":2017}

Additional influences include sleep, age, genes, medications, medical conditions, and environment.\n\n**Why it matters:**\nMaintaining a healthy weight supports overall health across the lifespan. Obesity raises the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.\n\n**Food and nutrition:**\nKnowing approximate calorie needs can help. The MyPlate Plan estimates daily calories based on age, sex, height, weight, and activity level, and suggests fruit, vegetable, protein, dairy, and grain amounts to meet nutritional needs. Eating a variety of foods is better than eliminating entire food groups; restriction can exclude vital nutrients and become unsustainable. Tracking intake with a food and beverage diary (including portion sizes and label-based calorie counts) reveals typical consumption patterns.\n\n**Physical activity guidelines:**\n- **Children 3–5:** Active throughout the day for growth and development.\n- **Children/adolescents 6–17:** At least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily, including aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening exercises.\n- **Healthy pregnant or postpartum women:** 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly (e.g., 30 minutes/day, 5 days/week).\n- **Adults:** 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (or an equivalent mix), plus muscle-strengthening activities on 2+ days weekly.\n- **Adults 65+:** At least 150 minutes/week of moderate activity, 2+ days of muscle strengthening, and balance activities (e.g., standing on one foot).\n\nPhysical activity alone doesn’t guarantee weight control if calorie intake exceeds expenditure, so nutrition awareness remains essential. Tracking activity with a diary can help maintain motivation.\n\n**Other factors:**\nAdequate sleep aids weight management. Age-related shifts reduce muscle mass and increase fat, slowing metabolism and encouraging weight gain, especially if activity declines. Diseases (e.g., Cushing’s disease, PCOS) and medications (steroids, some antidepressants) can drive weight gain. Genes can lead to rare single-gene obesity syndromes (Bardet-Biedl, Prader-Willi); more commonly, multiple genes interact with environmental factors. Environmental barriers like limited healthy food access, few safe activity spaces, or chemical exposures also affect weight. Consult healthcare providers about illnesses, medications, or barriers complicating weight control.\n\n**Resources:**\n- Nutrition in Daily Life\n- Tips for Healthy Eating for a Healthy Weight\n- Water and Healthier Drinks\n- Physical Activity in Daily Life\n- Physical Activity and Your Health\n- Physical Activity Benefits\n- About Sleep\n- Losing Weight (even 5–10% body-weight reductions yield health benefits)\n\nIntegrating balanced nutrition, appropriate physical activity, adequate sleep, and medical guidance helps sustain a healthy weight despite age, genetic, or environmental challenges.","category":"Public Health","tags":["healthy weight","nutrition","physical activity","sleep","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-weight-growth/about/tips-for-balancing-food-activity.html","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_132","title":"Managing Pain","body":"**Overview:**\nPain warns the body of danger, but chronic pain diminishes quality of life and drives doctor visits. Opioids block pain processing from skin to brain and can be effective, yet they also create euphoria, reinforcement, tolerance, and addiction risk. The opioid crisis—over 100 overdose deaths daily—underscores the need for treatments beyond opioids. NIH is investing in precise pain therapies and addiction solutions.\n\n**Opioids not always needed:**\nAcute pain (e.g., post-surgery) often responds well to non-opioid medications such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Dentists, who frequently prescribe opioids to teens and young adults, are urged to try alternatives first because early exposure increases long-term misuse risk. When opioids are necessary, clinicians now prescribe only a few pills to lower misuse and diversion.\n\n**Chronic pain complexities:**\nMore than 25 million Americans live with pain lasting over three months. Chronic pain can stem from damaged nerves or brain changes (central pain), where opioids may worsen symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) helps by reframing thoughts and behaviors, addressing sensory and emotional aspects, and improving sleep, mood, and fatigue since these functions share neurotransmitters with pain pathways. Certain non-opioid medications—initially designed for seizures, depression, or anxiety—can modulate pain processing. Devices that stimulate nerves (from skin-level to spinal cord) block pain signals. Exercise, acupuncture, massage, and yoga also show benefits for some pain types.\n\n**Expanding options:**\nNIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative aims to identify mechanisms that convert acute pain to chronic pain, predict who is at risk, and develop new non-addictive pain therapies alongside treatments for opioid misuse. Precision pain management would match therapies to specific “flavors” of pain.\n\n**Wise choices: dealing safely with pain**\n- Ask about non-opioid pain relief options\n- Inform providers of all medications you take\n- Share any personal or family history of addiction\n- Understand opioid risks and usage instructions\n- Avoid alcohol when taking opioids\n- Store opioids securely and dispose of leftovers promptly\n\nBroader, personalized pain-management tools can reduce reliance on opioids while improving quality of life for people living with pain.","category":"Pain Management","tags":["pain","opioids","chronic pain","HEAL initiative","NIH"],"source":"NIH News in Health","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2018/10/managing-pain","year":2018}

Women, children, and farmers in poor rural communities bear the highest burden, especially where health systems are weak.\n\n**Clinical severity and treatment:**\nVenomous bites cause acute emergencies—paralysis, bleeding disorders, kidney failure, and tissue destruction. Children may deteriorate faster. Effective antivenoms exist, and many deaths or complications are preventable if safe, high-quality antivenoms—listed as WHO essential medicines—are accessible in primary care.\n\n**Challenges producing antivenoms:**\nFew countries can produce suitable snake venoms for antivenom manufacture; many rely on commercial sources that don’t capture geographic variation. Weak regulatory capacity hinders quality control. Poor data, inadequate distribution, and weak regulation have reduced confidence in some products, driving manufacturers to halt production or raise prices and further decreasing demand.\n\n**Weak health systems and data gaps:**\nStrategic placement of antivenoms, trained staff, reliable equipment, and community outreach can reduce morbidity and mortality. However, remote areas often lack access to care. Under-reporting is widespread because many victims never reach facilities, opting for traditional treatments. Examples: Nepal’s official figures grossly underestimate true cases; community studies in India and Sri Lanka reveal far higher death tolls. Without robust data, national authorities miscalculate antivenom needs, leading to shortages and procurement of ineffective products.\n\n**Low production:**\nDeclining demand and high costs have driven manufacturers out, causing price hikes and reduced availability. In some regions, antivenoms have disappeared or been replaced by untested or fake products, further eroding trust. Without decisive action, Africa and parts of Asia face imminent supply failure.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO evaluated antivenom safety and effectiveness (initially in sub-Saharan Africa, later in South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean) to guide regulators and procurement agencies. Snakebite envenoming was designated a highest-priority neglected tropical disease in 2017. A WHO road map targets a 50% reduction in mortality and disability by 2030 via four objectives: empower communities, ensure safe treatment, strengthen health systems, and expand partnerships/resources.\n\nWHO coordinates capacity-building projects—community engagement toolkits, interventions to improve access to WHO-recommended antivenoms, strengthened regulation/control, better data collection and geospatial risk modeling, and integration into national health plans. WHO urges global collaboration to improve epidemiological data, regulatory oversight, and distribution.\n\n**Tools and guidance:**\n- Guidelines for the production, control, and regulation of snake antivenom immunoglobulins\n- Public benefit target product profiles for snake antivenoms in sub-Saharan Africa\n- Snakebite Information and Data Platform (SIDP)\n\nThese support public health officials, regulators, procurement agencies, manufacturers, clinicians, and communities in determining needs, ensuring quality, and improving awareness of local venomous species.\n\n**Key message:**\nExpanding access to safe, effective antivenoms, strengthening health systems, improving data, and engaging communities can dramatically reduce the preventable deaths and disabilities caused by snakebite envenoming.","category":"Neglected Tropical Diseases","tags":["snakebite","antivenom","neglected tropical disease","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/snakebite-envenoming","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_134","title":"Plague","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Plague is caused by *Yersinia pestis*, a zoonotic bacterium in small mammals and their fleas.\n- Symptoms typically appear 1–7 days after infection.\n- Main clinical forms: bubonic (painful swollen lymph nodes or buboes) and pneumonic.\n- Transmission occurs via infected flea bites, contact with infected tissues, or inhalation of respiratory droplets from pneumonic cases.\n- Bubonic plague has a 30–60% case-fatality rate; pneumonic plague is invariably fatal if untreated.\n- Early antibiotic treatment is effective and lifesaving.\n- Most endemic countries today: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.\n\n**Overview:**\n*Y. pestis* circulates among small mammals and fleas. Humans become infected through vector bites, contact with infected tissues, or inhaling droplets from pneumonic patients. Septicaemic and pneumonic forms are particularly severe and can provoke fatal epidemics if untreated. Plague historically caused the “Black Death,” killing over 50 million in 14th-century Europe, but is now treatable with antibiotics and standard precautions.\n\n**Signs and symptoms:**\nAfter a 1–7 day incubation, patients develop acute fever, chills, aches, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Bubonic plague arises from flea bites; bacteria travel to nearby lymph nodes, causing inflamed buboes that can become pus-filled sores. Human-to-human spread of bubonic plague is rare, but the infection can progress to pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is lung-based, highly virulent, and can incubate within 24 hours. It spreads via respiratory droplets and is fatal without rapid treatment, though timely therapy yields high recovery rates.\n\n**Geographic distribution:**\nPlague persists on every continent except Oceania wherever natural foci (bacteria, animal reservoir, vector) intersect with people. Since the 1990s, most human cases occur in Africa; the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru are the most endemic countries. Madagascar reports seasonal bubonic outbreaks nearly every year (September–April).\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nConfirmation requires laboratory testing. *Y. pestis* can be identified from bubo pus, blood, or sputum. Rapid dipstick tests detecting specific antigens are widely used in Africa and South America with WHO support.\n\n**Treatment:**\nEarly antibiotics and supportive care are crucial. Untreated pneumonic plague can be fatal within 18–24 hours, but common antibiotics for gram-negative bacteria are effective when administered promptly.\n\n**Prevention:**\nEducate communities about zoonotic plague risks, avoiding flea bites, and not handling animal carcasses. Avoid direct contact with infectious body fluids or tissues. Apply standard precautions when handling suspected patients or specimens.\n\n**Vaccination:**\nVaccination isn’t generally recommended, except for high-risk groups (lab personnel and healthcare workers with repeated exposure).\n\n**Managing outbreaks:**\n- Identify and control the infection source, focusing on areas with animal die-offs; implement infection prevention and control (IPC); perform vector control before rodent control to prevent flea dispersal.\n- Protect health workers with IPC training, standard precautions, and chemoprophylaxis during exposure to pneumonic patients.\n- Ensure correct antibiotic treatment and adequate drug supplies.\n- Isolate pneumonic patients and provide masks to limit droplet spread.\n- Monitor close contacts and provide seven-day chemoprophylaxis; household members of bubonic patients also need prophylaxis.\n- Collect specimens using appropriate IPC and send for laboratory testing.\n- Disinfect with routine hand hygiene and 10% diluted bleach for larger areas.\n- Practice safe burials by covering suspected pneumonic plague victims with disinfectant-soaked cloth rather than spraying.\n\n**Surveillance and control:**\nUnderstanding local animal reservoirs and vectors, managing environments, and maintaining active surveillance of animal foci with rapid response help reduce outbreaks. Effective management requires trained healthcare workers, quick diagnosis, risk-factor identification, vector/host control, lab confirmation, and communication with authorities.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO maintains surveillance, supports preparedness, and issues region-specific guidelines (India subcontinent, South America, sub-Saharan Africa). WHO assists ministries of health with field control during outbreaks.\n","category":"Infectious Diseases","tags":["plague","Yersinia pestis","bubonic plague","pneumonic plague","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/plague","year":2022}

{"id":"DOC_135","title":"Yoga for Health","body":"**Overview:**\nOne in seven U.S. adults practiced yoga in the past year to relax, stay fit, or support wellbeing. Rooted in Indian philosophy, yoga engages body and mind through physical poses, breathing techniques, and meditation. Modern practice emphasizes physical movement, but mindfulness develops with time. Yoga styles vary: some hold poses slowly; others link flowing movements to breath.\n\n**Evidence so far:**\nStudies suggest yoga can aid general wellness—managing stress, improving mental health, supporting weight loss, or assisting smoking cessation. Research indicates potential benefits for medical concerns, including pain relief, reduced menopause symptoms, and improved sleep among older adults or people with cancer. Multiple trials show yoga helps chronic low back pain, leading some experts to recommend it as a first-line, non-drug therapy. However, more rigorous research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions, so yoga should complement—not replace—clinical care. The specific “active ingredient” remains unclear because yoga combines physical, mental, and spiritual components. Ongoing studies are testing yoga’s role in populations such as military veterans, breast cancer survivors, and people experiencing anxiety, depression, or PTSD.\n\n**Getting started safely:**\n- Begin slowly to avoid injury; focus on physical aspects before meditation becomes easier.\n- Consult a healthcare provider if you have medical conditions, are pregnant, or are older.\n- Inform instructors about your health needs; choose experienced teachers who adapt poses to individual abilities.\n- Consider a yoga therapist, who has more extensive training to address specific conditions in small groups or one-on-one settings.\n\n**Wise Choices: Starting yoga**\n- Select beginner, gentle, or senior classes aligned with your level.\n- Ask about instructors’ training and experience.\n- Go slowly, avoid extreme positions or forceful breathing, and listen to your body.\n- Let instructors know about injuries or medical issues.\n- Explore clinical studies on yoga at ClinicalTrials.gov if interested in research participation.\n\nYoga’s blend of movement, breath, and mindfulness can support physical and mental health when practiced mindfully and in concert with medical advice.","category":"Healthy Living","tags":["yoga","mind-body","stress management","chronic pain","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2019/11/yoga-health","year":2019}

{"id":"DOC_136","title":"Family Health Matters","body":"**Overview:**\nTwin studies help scientists untangle how genes and environment influence health. Since many conditions run in families, sharing genes with relatives raises your risk. Identical twins share the same DNA, womb, home environment, and parents, making them natural experiments. As twins age and live separate lives, researchers can see how different exposures affect disease risk.\n\n**Twin basics:**\n- **Identical twins** form when a fertilized egg splits into two embryos, producing twins with identical genes, same sex, and similar features.\n- **Fraternal twins** result from separate eggs fertilized by different sperm; they’re like typical siblings but share birth timing.\n\n**Research insights:**\nDr. Thomas Mack studies twins to understand breast cancer risk. Common factors—age at first childbirth, age at menarche and menopause, and alcohol use—couldn’t explain why only one identical twin developed cancer. Comparing identical and fraternal twins helps identify environmental influences beyond genetics. Twin research aims to uncover new risk factors and improve prevention strategies.\n\n**Family health history for everyone:**\nEven without a twin, knowing your family health history empowers better care. Share information with healthcare providers to assess personal risk and discuss prevention.\n\n**Wise Choices: Use your family health history**\n- Talk with relatives about conditions they’ve had and ages at diagnosis or death; note both sides of the family.\n- Ask about chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, or stroke.\n- Record and update the history; tools like My Family Health Portrait help organize details.\n- Share information with your healthcare team to guide screening and risk-reduction plans.\n\nTwin studies expand understanding of disease causes, while personal family histories help individuals and providers make informed health decisions.","category":"Family Health","tags":["twins","genetics","family history","breast cancer","NIH"],"source":"NIH","url":"https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2019/10/family-health-matters","year":2019}

{"id":"DOC_137","title":"Heat and health","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and worsens illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, mental health conditions, and some infectious diseases; heatstroke is a medical emergency with a high fatality rate.\n- Extreme heat exposure is rising globally due to climate change; heat-related mortality in people over 65 increased ~85% between 2000–2004 and 2017–2021. Between 2000–2019, ~489 000 heat-related deaths occurred annually (45% in Asia, 36% in Europe). Europe recorded an estimated 61 672 excess heat deaths in summer 2022; past heatwaves (Europe 2003, Russian Federation 2010) caused tens of thousands of deaths.\n- Vulnerability depends on physiological factors (age, health status) and exposure factors (occupation, socio-economic conditions).\n- Heat impacts are predictable and largely preventable through public health and multisectoral policies; WHO provides guidance for managing extreme heat risks.\n\n**Overview:**\nHeatwaves—periods of unusually hot days and nights—are intensifying in frequency, duration, and magnitude due to climate change. Extended high temperatures stress the body, raising risks of illness and death, triggering public health emergencies, and causing socio-economic losses (reduced labour productivity, disrupted services). Ageing populations and rising noncommunicable diseases increase susceptibility. Urbanization choices (loss of greenspace, heat-amplifying materials) exacerbate exposure. Awareness remains insufficient among health workers and the public, necessitating tailored guidance and rapid intervention when heat alerts are issued.\n\n**Who is affected?**\nChronic high temperatures affect tropical and subtropical populations; mid/high latitudes face seasonal exposure. Physiological vulnerability (older adults, people with chronic conditions) and occupational or socio-economic exposures (outdoor workers, informal settlements, gender roles) increase risk. Outdoor/manual workers, athletes, and emergency responders are prone to exertional heat stress. Poor housing and lack of cooling heighten exposure for urban/rural poor; women often experience additional indoor heat due to cooking responsibilities.\n\n**Health impacts:**\nHeat load rises when the body cannot dissipate internal metabolic heat due to high temperature, humidity, low wind, radiant heat, occlusive clothing, or external heat gain. Failure to regulate temperature leads to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, and strains the heart and kidneys. Heat exacerbates chronic conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, mental health, diabetes) and can cause acute kidney injury. Deaths/hospitalizations occur rapidly during heatwaves, demanding swift interventions. Heat events can disrupt health services (power outages, transport failures), reduce productivity, elevate accident risk, and coincide with hazardous air pollution. Impact severity depends on heat event timing, intensity, duration, and population/infrastructure adaptability.\n\n**Public actions:**\n- **Stay out of the heat:** Avoid strenuous outdoor activity during peak heat; seek shade; spend 2–3 hours daily in a cool place; never swim alone; heed heat warnings.\n- **Keep homes cool:** Ventilate at night when cooler outside; during daytime, close windows/blinds; minimize heat-generating devices; use fans only when <40 °C; if using air conditioning, set to 27 °C with a fan to feel ~4 °C cooler and save energy; consider shaded outdoor areas.\n- **Keep body cool and hydrated:** Wear light, loose clothing; take cool showers/baths; moisten skin (damp cloth, spray); drink at least 2–3 litres daily (about 1 cup/hour); regularly check on vulnerable individuals (over 65, chronic conditions, disabilities, living alone).\n- **Protect infants/children:** Never leave children/animals in parked vehicles; limit sun exposure during peak hours; avoid covering strollers with dry fabric (use damp cloth and portable fan); dress children in lightweight protective clothing, hats, sunglasses, sunscreen; follow home-cooling tips.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO urges rapid climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lessen future heat impacts. Through the Alliance for Transformational Change in Climate and Health (ATACH), WHO supports countries with technical and policy resources to adapt health systems and communities. WHO collaborates on heat action plans, early warning systems, and emergency response plans to protect high-risk populations (health facilities, nursing homes, schools without cooling). WHO co-sponsors the Global Heat Health Information Network and partners with the World Meteorological Organization on Heat Health Warning Systems to enhance preparedness and protect vulnerable populations.","category":"Climate and Health","tags":["heatwaves","climate change","heat stress","public health","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-heat-and-health","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_138","title":"Human rights and health","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Human rights belong to all people irrespective of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n- The right to health and related rights are legally binding commitments in international instruments; WHO’s Constitution affirms the right to health.\n- Everyone has the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. States are legally obligated to enact laws and policies that ensure universal access to quality health services and address root causes of inequity (poverty, stigma, discrimination).\n- The right to health is inseparable from rights to education, participation, food, housing, work, and information.\n- Universal health coverage grounded in primary health care helps realize the right to health by ensuring affordable, equitable access to services.\n\n**Overview:**\nAll WHO Member States have ratified at least one human rights treaty recognizing the right to health. Ratification creates legal obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill these rights. Delivering on commitments requires adopting a human rights-based approach (HRBA) to health.\n\n**Health and human rights:**\nThe right to health includes freedoms (control over one’s body/health, freedom from non-consensual treatment, protection from torture) and entitlements (non-discriminatory access to quality services). HRBA calls for rights-compliant, gender-transformative, accountable health systems and actions addressing determinants such as water and sanitation. Applying human rights frameworks (e.g., to reproductive health) exposes how discrimination and poor services drive preventable mortality and morbidity.\n\n**Fundamental principles:**\n- **Non-discrimination and equality:** Prioritize those furthest behind to achieve equity. Address intersecting discrimination (gender, race, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status). Use intersectional approaches to deliver accessible information and services.\n- **Participation:** Empower service users, communities, and civil society to engage in planning, decision-making, and implementation across all system levels. Mitigate power imbalances, value lived experience, and manage conflicts of interest to meet people’s needs.\n- **Accountability:** Provide accessible administrative/judicial remedies and oversight (national human rights institutions, regulators). UN mechanisms (e.g., Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) review compliance. Regulate non-state actors (private sector, NGOs) to ensure human rights protection—e.g., tobacco advertising bans under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (66 countries have full bans).\n\n**Progressive realization and cooperation:**\nSome obligations (non-discrimination) are immediate; others (access to advanced technologies) follow progressive realization. States must use maximum available resources for rights-based policies/programmes. States able to assist must cooperate with those with fewer resources.\n\n**Core components of the right to health:**\n- **Availability:** Sufficient functioning facilities, goods, and services, measured via disaggregated data and qualitative surveys to identify gaps.\n- **Accessibility:** Services must be non-discriminatory, physically reachable, affordable, and information-accessible. Requires norms/standards to remove barriers, especially for marginalized groups (e.g., persons with disabilities).\n- **Acceptability:** Services must respect medical ethics, be culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive, people-centered, and uphold confidentiality/informed consent.\n- **Quality:** Facilities and interventions must be scientifically/medically sound and include underlying determinants (safe water, sanitation). Quality aligns with UHC principles: safe, effective, people-centered, timely, equitable, integrated, efficient.\n\n**Treaties including the right to health:**\n- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (Art. 12)\n- International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Art. 5(e)(iv))\n- Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Arts. 11(1)(f), 12, 14(2)(b))\n- Convention on the Rights of the Child (Art. 24)\n- International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (Arts. 28, 43(e), 45(c))\n- Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Art. 25)\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO supports countries to uphold health-related human rights by:\n- Advocating for the right to health and related rights through communications.\n- Raising awareness (e.g., safe healthcare rights).\n- Assisting integration of human rights standards into laws, programmes, and policies (e.g., mental health, sexual/reproductive health guidance).\n- Building policymaker capacity on HRBA.\n- Providing evidence, analysis, and recommendations on health and human rights.\n- Collaborating with UN entities to embed human rights into service delivery (e.g., implementing the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy across WHO).\n","category":"Human Rights","tags":["human rights","right to health","universal health coverage","equity","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_139","title":"Climate change","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Climate change drives humanitarian emergencies such as heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms, and hurricanes, which are increasing in scale, frequency, and intensity.\n- About 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Between 2030–2050, climate change is expected to cause roughly 250 000 additional deaths annually from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, and heat stress alone.\n- Direct health damage costs (excluding agriculture, water, sanitation) are estimated at US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030.\n- Regions with weak health infrastructure—mostly developing countries—will struggle most without assistance.\n- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions through improved transport, food systems, and energy choices yields major health gains, especially via reduced air pollution.\n\n**Overview:**\nClimate change is a fundamental threat to human health, affecting physical environments and natural/social systems. It is a threat multiplier, risking reversal of decades of health progress. Intensifying climate hazards (storms, heat, floods, droughts, wildfires) increase deaths, noncommunicable diseases, infectious disease spread, and health emergencies. Climate shocks degrade environmental and social determinants of health and strain health workforce/infrastructure, undermining universal health coverage (UHC). Delaying action raises health risks and violates commitments to the right to health.\n\n**Impacts on health:**\nThe IPCC Sixth Assessment Report indicates climate risks are emerging faster and will intensify sooner than expected, making adaptation harder. Despite minimal emissions, low-income countries and small island developing states face the harshest impacts; vulnerable regions experienced a death rate 15 times higher from extreme weather in the last decade. Health impacts include deaths/illness from extreme weather, disrupted food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-/water-/vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Social determinants like livelihoods, equality, and health access are undermined. Vulnerable groups—women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants, older adults, people with underlying conditions—bear disproportionate burdens.\n\nWHO data show 2 billion people lack safe drinking water and 600 million suffer foodborne illnesses annually (children under five suffer 30% of fatalities). Climate stressors heighten waterborne/foodborne disease risks. In 2020, 770 million faced hunger, mainly in Africa and Asia. Temperature and precipitation changes expand vector-borne diseases; without preventive action, deaths (currently >700 000 annually) may rise. Climate change exacerbates mental health issues through acute events (anxiety, PTSD) and chronic stressors (displacement, social disruption). About 37% of heat-related deaths are attributed to human-induced climate change; heat-related deaths in those over 65 increased 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98 million more people experienced food insecurity versus 1981–2010 averages. Climate shocks risk reversing 50 years of development and health gains, worsening barriers to care and pushing ~100 million people into poverty annually.\n\n**Climate change and equity:**\nShort- to medium-term impacts depend on population vulnerability, resilience, and adaptation capacity; long-term effects hinge on transformative emission reductions to avoid dangerous thresholds and tipping points. Those most affected (low-income and disadvantaged communities) contribute least to emissions. Equity demands high emitters bear greater mitigation and adaptation costs.\n\n**Need for urgent action:**\nLimiting warming to 1.5 °C is critical to avert catastrophic health impacts. Past emissions guarantee some warming, but every fraction of a degree worsens health outcomes.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO’s strategy rests on three objectives:\n1. **Promote mitigation actions with health co-benefits:** Advocate rapid, equitable transition to clean energy; ensure health is central to mitigation policies; prioritize actions with large health gains; mobilize the health community to drive policy and public support.\n2. **Build climate-resilient, environmentally sustainable health systems:** Embed core services, sustainability, and resilience in UHC/PHC; support systems to leapfrog to cleaner, reliable solutions; decarbonize high-emitting health systems; integrate climate resilience into health investments and workforce capacity.\n3. **Protect health from diverse climate impacts:** Assess vulnerabilities; develop climate-informed health plans; integrate climate risk into surveillance/response (e.g., extreme heat, infectious disease); bolster resilience in health-determining sectors (water, food); close financing gaps for adaptation and resilience.\n\nWHO also leads efforts in leadership/awareness (placing health at the center of climate policies, targeting carbon neutrality by 2030), evidence/monitoring (providing data, guidance, progress tracking), and capacity building/country support (supporting ministries, cross-sector collaboration, training, project implementation, climate-health financing). WHO leads the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH) to help countries realize climate-resilient, low-carbon health systems.","category":"Climate and Health","tags":["climate change","health impacts","equity","UHC","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_140","title":"Drowning","body":"**Key facts:**\n- About 300 000 people die from drowning each year.\n- Children are disproportionately affected; those under five account for nearly one-quarter of all drowning deaths.\n- Drowning is the 4th leading cause of death for children aged 1–4 and the 3rd for ages 5–14.\n- Ninety-two percent of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n- UN General Assembly and World Health Assembly resolutions outline global drowning prevention roadmaps.\n\n**Overview:**\nDrowning is respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid, with outcomes classified as death, morbidity, or no morbidity. Global burden spans all regions, but LMICs have drowning death rates over three times higher than high-income countries. More than half of drownings occur in WHO Western Pacific and South-East Asia regions. The global drowning death rate fell 38% since 2000 (6.1 to 3.8 per 100 000), yet progress lags behind Sustainable Development Goal targets, and drowning remains a preventable crisis.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- **Age:** Young children lack risk assessment, swimming, and water safety skills. Children/young adults (0–29) account for 57% of drownings; highest rates are in ages 0–4 (e.g., 16.8 deaths per 100 000 in Eastern Mediterranean). In Western Pacific, drowning is the top cause of death for ages 5–14.\n- **Sex:** Male drowning death rates are more than double female rates; men have higher non-fatal drowning hospitalization rates due to greater exposure and riskier behaviours (swimming alone, alcohol use, boating).\n- **Poverty/inequality:** Reliance on natural water sources for daily activities in LMICs increases exposure. Marginalized communities face higher risks.\n- **Occupational exposure:** Commercial/subsistence fishers face high drowning risk; FAO estimates >32 000 fisher deaths annually. Climate change intensifies hazardous working conditions.\n- **Climate-related risks:** More extreme events (floods, heatwaves) elevate drowning; 75% of flood disaster deaths are due to drowning. LMICs suffer greater risks due to limited warning systems and infrastructure. Heatwaves drive more people to water for relief, increasing exposure.\n- **Water transport:** Inadequate regulation and safety measures in LMICs make daily commutes via water risky (overcrowded, unsafe vessels, untrained operators).\n- **Migration/refuge:** Displacement due to conflict, instability, or climate change forces people into dangerous migration routes across water in unsafe vessels without safety equipment.\n\n**Prevention:**\nMeasures include covering wells, doorway barriers, playpens, pool fencing, and controlled access to water hazards. Community-based supervised childcare for preschoolers reduces risk and yields other health benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety, and safe rescue skills must be done with safety-tested curricula, suitable training environments, screening, and appropriate student-to-instructor ratios. WHO guidance (2022) outlines day-care, swimming, and safe rescue training.\n\nWHO’s investment case (to 2050) shows cost savings by scaling two interventions: preschool day-care and basic swim skills education. These could prevent 774 000 child drowning deaths and 178 000 severe non-fatal injuries, saving >US$ 400 billion (9:1 return on investment). Effective policies—safe boating/shipping/ferry regulations, flood resilience, preparedness, land-use planning, early warning systems—and national water safety strategies provide structural prevention frameworks.\n\n**WHO response:**\nThe Global status report on drowning prevention highlights declining rates but emphasizes remaining urgency. Governments must reinforce proven measures and integrate drowning prevention into broader public health agendas. In April 2021, the UN General Assembly adopted the first resolution on drowning prevention, linking it to sustainable development, equity, urban health, climate change, disaster risk reduction, and child health, and designated 25 July as World Drowning Prevention Day. In May 2023, the 76th World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to accelerate action through 2029, committing WHO to establish a Global Alliance for Drowning Prevention and produce a global status report (2024).\n\nWHO works with ministries of health in LMICs to develop national drowning prevention strategies and implement evidence-based interventions. It funds research in low-income countries on priority drowning prevention questions and convenes regional trainings/workshops with governments, NGOs, and UN agencies. Related resources include the Global status report, “Hidden depths” investment case, implementation guides, and practical guidance for day-care, swimming, and rescue training.","category":"Injury Prevention","tags":["drowning","child safety","injury prevention","climate risk","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drowning","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_141","title":"Condoms","body":"**Key facts:**\n- In 2020, 374 million new infections with one of four curable STIs (syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis) occurred among adults 15–49; correct condom use could prevent most of these infections.\n- Modelling suggests increased condom use since 1990 has averted ~117 million new HIV infections, nearly half in sub-Saharan Africa and over one-third in Asia/Pacific.\n- When male condoms are used correctly every time, 98% of women are protected from unplanned pregnancy over a year; correct female condom use protects 95%.\n- Nearly one-third of European adolescents report using neither condoms nor contraceptive pills at last intercourse, a proportion unchanged since 2018.\n- Non-judgmental, person-centred information supports condom use; gender inequities in relationships often hinder it.\n- WHO/HRP research shows positive messaging about sex and pleasure improves condom uptake.\n\n**Overview:**\nCondoms (external/male and internal/female) are safe, inexpensive, widely available, and highly effective at preventing most STIs (including HIV) and unintended pregnancies when used correctly and consistently. Lubricants reduce breakage and enhance comfort; water- or silicone-based lubes are recommended, especially for anal sex or vaginal dryness. Oil-based products (kitchen oils, butter, lotions) can degrade condoms.\n\n**Effectiveness:**\nCondom efficacy depends on consistent, correct use. Failures due to slips/breaks are rare compared with non-use or incorrect use. Condoms lower the risk of most STIs during vaginal, oral, and anal sex when used properly. They should meet ISO standards and WHO/UNFPA specifications to ensure quality.\n\n**Global impact:**\nCondoms are currently the only multi-purpose prevention technology addressing HIV, STIs, and unintended pregnancy simultaneously. Contraceptive use, including condoms, prevents over 300 million unintended pregnancies annually. In high-burden HIV countries, expanded condom use has significantly curtailed new infections and remains critical to future epidemic control.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO provides technical guidance to strengthen sexual and reproductive health programmes, encompassing STI/HIV prevention and family planning. Condoms are embedded in comprehensive sexuality education, gender-based violence responses, and the Global health sector strategy on HIV, Hepatitis and STIs (2022–2030), which emphasizes scaling primary prevention and ensuring enabling environments for discussing STIs and adopting safer sexual practices.\n\nWHO co-sponsors the Human Reproduction Programme (HRP), spearheading research priorities to improve sexual and reproductive health. The Organization also issues evidence-based contraceptive guidelines, quality standards, and prequalification for contraceptive commodities, supporting countries to introduce preferred methods and guarantee reproductive autonomy.\n\nResponding to declining condom use among European adolescents, WHO/Europe urges policymakers, educators, and providers to prioritize adolescent sexual health through evidence-based school curricula, youth-friendly services, stigma reduction, specialized training, and research on behavioural drivers (e.g., social media influences).\n","category":"Sexual and Reproductive Health","tags":["condoms","STI prevention","HIV","contraception","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/condoms","year":2025}

{"id":"DOC_142","title":"Behavior therapy first for young children with ADHD","body":"**At a glance:**\nExperts recommend behavior therapy—specifically parent training in behavior management—as the first-line ADHD treatment for children under six. Parents work with therapists to learn strategies that help manage symptoms before considering medication.\n\n**Overview:**\nMany children with severe ADHD symptoms receive diagnoses before age six. While distractibility and high activity can be typical in young children, persistent, severe symptoms interfere with learning, peer relationships, and safety. Early, appropriate treatment is crucial.\n\n**After diagnosis:**\nFor older children, combined medication and behavior therapy often works best. For children under six, behavior therapy should be tried first. Parent training in behavior management (PTBM) equips caregivers with skills to support their child and improve behavior. Families can also seek resources like the National Resource Center on ADHD (CHADD program).\n\n**How parent training helps:**\nChildren with ADHD may forget instructions, act impulsively, and struggle to gain positive attention, resulting in frequent punishment and poor self-esteem. PTBM helps parents understand ADHD, build effective parenting skills, strengthen parent-child relationships, and teach children self-regulation. Childcare providers and educators can also learn behavioral techniques to support preschoolers with ADHD.\n\n**Why behavior therapy first:**\n- Children under six are more susceptible to medication side effects (elevated heart rate/blood pressure, sleep problems, appetite loss, low energy).\n- Long-term medication effects in this age group are unknown.\n- Behavior therapy can manage symptoms as effectively as medication in young children, with improvements lasting years after training.\n- Evidence-based PTBM programs meet Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria for effective treatments.\n\n**CDC actions:**\nThe CDC collaborates with states and partners to promote behavior therapy, monitors ADHD prevalence and treatment via national surveys, studies diagnostic practices, and funds the National Resource Center on ADHD to disseminate evidence-based information.\n\n**What families can do:**\n- Discuss behavior therapy with healthcare providers as the first treatment option.\n- Share information about PTBM with other families to encourage early, evidence-based care.\n","category":"Neurodevelopmental Disorders","tags":["ADHD","behavior therapy","parent training","preschool","CDC"],"source":"CDC","url":"https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/articles/behavior-therapy-first-young-children.html","year":2024}

{"id":"DOC_143","title":"Food additives","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Food additives are substances added mainly to processed or industrially produced foods for technical purposes (e.g., safety, shelf life, sensory attributes).\n- They are not typically consumed alone or used as standard ingredients; most minimally processed foods lack additives.\n- Additives must undergo safety assessments before authorization.\n- National, regional, and international bodies evaluate additive safety.\n- The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) evaluates additives for foods traded internationally.\n\n**Overview:**\nAdditives ensure processed foods remain safe and high-quality from production to consumption and modify sensory properties (taste, aroma, texture, appearance). They may be derived from plants, animals, minerals, or synthesized chemically. Thousands exist, each with specific functions. Major categories include flavouring agents, enzyme preparations, and other functional additives (preservatives, colourings, sweeteners).\n\n**Flavouring agents:**\nUsed to alter aroma or taste; hundreds exist across diverse foods. They can be natural (extracted from sources), “nature identical” (chemically synthesized but identical to natural molecules), or artificial (synthesized to mimic or create flavours not found in nature). Culinary ingredients like spices can influence flavour but aren’t classified as flavouring agents.\n\n**Enzyme preparations:**\nThese additives facilitate biochemical reactions, breaking down larger molecules. Extracted from plants, animals, or microorganisms, they’re used in baking (dough improvement), juice production (higher yields), wine/beer brewing (fermentation), and cheese making (curd formation). They may or may not remain in the final product.\n\n**Other additives:**\n- **Preservatives** slow decomposition from mould, air, bacteria, or yeast, preventing spoilage and foodborne illnesses (e.g., botulism).\n- **Colourings** restore or enhance visual appeal lost during processing.\n- **Non-sugar sweeteners** offer low- or no-calorie alternatives. WHO recommends against routine use of non-sugar sweeteners because they show limited benefit for weight management and may raise noncommunicable disease risk.\n\n**Safety assessments:**\nAdditives must be evaluated for potential health effects before approval. JECFA assesses additives used in international trade, reviewing biochemical/toxicological data from animal tests, human studies, and other research. Evaluations determine acceptable daily intake (ADI)—the lifetime daily amount considered safe.\n\n**WHO response:**\n- **Health risk evaluation:** WHO and FAO oversee additive risk assessments through JECFA. Only additives deemed low-risk at specified levels are permitted internationally. National authorities can authorize use based on JECFA or their own assessments.\n- **International standards:** Codex Alimentarius uses JECFA assessments to set maximum levels in foods/drinks, forming global benchmarks for safety and trade. After Codex approval, nations must implement regulations permitting use under defined conditions.\n- **Labelling:** Codex sets labelling standards requiring manufacturers to disclose additives. Regions like the EU use E-numbers to categorize additives. People with allergies or sensitivities should check labels. National authorities must monitor additive use for compliance; food businesses bear primary responsibility for safe, lawful use.\n\nAdditive oversight ensures consumers worldwide can trust the safety and quality of foods, regardless of origin.","category":"Food Safety","tags":["food additives","JECFA","Codex Alimentarius","food safety","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/food-additives","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_144","title":"Listeriosis","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Listeriosis is serious but preventable and treatable.\n- Pregnant women, older adults, and immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV, cancer, transplant, steroid therapy) face the highest risk of severe disease and should avoid high-risk foods (deli and ready-to-eat meats, soft cheeses, cold-smoked fish).\n- *Listeria monocytogenes* is widespread in soil, water, vegetation, and animal faeces and can contaminate foods.\n- The disease is caused by *L. monocytogenes* and is a major foodborne concern due to high mortality despite relatively low incidence (0.1–10 cases per million people annually).\n\n**Overview:**\n*L. monocytogenes* can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures, setting it apart from many other foodborne pathogens. Infection usually follows ingestion of food containing high bacterial loads; human-to-human transmission can occur from pregnant women to fetuses. Foods with long refrigerated shelf-life and those consumed without further cooking present heightened risk. Past outbreaks implicated ready-to-eat meats (frankfurters, patés, smoked salmon), fermented raw sausages, dairy products (soft cheeses, unpasteurized milk, ice cream), prepared salads (coleslaw, sprouts), and fresh produce.\n\n**The disease:**\nTwo forms exist:\n- **Non-invasive (febrile listerial gastroenteritis):** affects otherwise healthy individuals; symptoms include diarrhoea, fever, headache, myalgia; incubation a few days; linked to foods with high bacterial loads.\n- **Invasive listeriosis:** targets high-risk groups (pregnant women, cancer/HIV/transplant patients, elderly, infants). Symptoms include fever, myalgia, septicemia, meningitis; mortality 20–30%. Incubation usually 1–2 weeks but can range from a few days up to 90 days. Pregnant women are ~20 times more likely to contract listeriosis, risking miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight, neonatal septicaemia, and meningitis. People with HIV are at least 300 times more likely to fall ill. Long incubation complicates source identification.\n\nDiagnosis relies on clinical presentation and detection of *L. monocytogenes* in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, fetal/newborn samples, and suspected foods. PCR and culture methods (blood, placenta) are employed.\n\n**Treatment:**\nEarly antibiotic therapy (e.g., for meningitis) is effective; prompt treatment during pregnancy prevents fetal/neonatal infection.\n\n**Control methods:**\nComprehensive control across the food chain is essential. *L. monocytogenes* resists common preservation (salt, smoke, acidity) and grows at ~5 °C, demanding integrated approaches: Good Hygienic Practices (GHP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems, microbiological testing, and environmental monitoring to locate/eliminate contamination niches. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) accelerates linking patient isolates with food sources during outbreaks.\n\n**Prevention:**\nThe bacteria are killed by pasteurization and cooking. Prevention mirrors general food safety guidance, encapsulated in WHO’s Five Keys to Safer Food: keep clean; separate raw/cooked; cook thoroughly; keep food at safe temperatures; use safe water/raw materials. High-risk individuals should avoid unpasteurized dairy, deli/ready-to-eat meats, and cold-smoked seafood, and adhere to shelf-life/storage instructions on ready-to-eat foods. Cooking before consumption effectively kills bacteria.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO strengthens food safety systems, promotes GMP, and educates retailers/consumers on safe handling, focusing on high-risk groups. Together with FAO, WHO issued a quantitative risk assessment for *L. monocytogenes* in ready-to-eat foods, informing Codex guidelines (CXG 61-2007) and microbiological criteria. WHO and FAO manage the International Network of Food Safety Authorities (INFOSAN) to support surveillance, coordination, and outbreak response across Member States.","category":"Food Safety","tags":["listeriosis","Listeria monocytogenes","foodborne disease","food safety","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/listeriosis","year":2018}

{"id":"DOC_145","title":"Natural toxins in food","body":"**Key facts:**\n- Natural toxins can form in food via plant defense mechanisms, infestation with toxin-producing moulds, or animals ingesting toxin-producing microorganisms.\n- These toxins can cause acute and chronic health effects in humans and livestock; some are extremely potent.\n- Acute effects range from allergic reactions to severe gastrointestinal illness and death; long-term effects include immune, reproductive, nervous system damage, and cancer.\n- The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) evaluates health risks from natural toxins in food.\n- Codex Alimentarius standards/codes of practice limit exposure based on JECFA assessments.\n\n**What are natural toxins?**\nNaturally produced toxic compounds that can harm other organisms, including humans, when ingested. They vary widely in structure, function, and toxicity. Plants may produce them for defense or in response to stress (e.g., drought, humidity). Microscopic algae/plankton can generate toxins retained in shellfish/fish and undetectable by taste or smell.\n\n**Major toxin groups:**\n- **Aquatic biotoxins:** Algal toxins (e.g., ciguatoxins) in shellfish/fish cause gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms; they withstand cooking/freezing.\n- **Cyanogenic glycosides:** Present in cassava, sorghum, stone fruits, bamboo roots, almonds. Can release cyanide, causing rapid breathing, hypotension, dizziness, gastrointestinal distress, convulsions, and death at high exposure.\n- **Furocoumarins:** Stress-induced toxins in parsnips, celery root, citrus, some medicinal plants. Phototoxic—cause severe skin reactions under UV exposure; large ingestion can trigger gastrointestinal issues.\n- **Lectins:** Found in beans, especially red kidney beans; raw consumption of few beans causes severe GI symptoms. Proper soaking and boiling destroy lectins.\n- **Mycotoxins:** Produced by moulds on cereals, dried fruits, nuts, spices pre- or post-harvest. Chemically stable; acute exposure causes severe illness/death, chronic exposure linked to cancer and immune deficiency.\n- **Solanines/chaconine:** Glycoalkaloids in solanaceae (potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants). Concentrated in sprouts, green/bitter parts; levels rise under stress. Store potatoes in dark, cool, dry places; avoid green/sprouting parts.\n- **Poisonous mushrooms:** Contain muscimol, muscarine, etc., causing GI and neurologic symptoms; delayed severe cases damage liver/kidney/nerve systems. Cooking/peeling doesn’t remove toxins; avoid unidentified wild mushrooms.\n- **Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs):** Produced by ~600 plant species (Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae); often weeds contaminating crops. Some PAs are DNA-damaging and potentially carcinogenic. Present in herbal teas, honey, herbs/spices, cereals; exposure generally low but risk management guidance is under development.\n\n**Minimizing risk:**\n- Don’t assume “natural” equals safe.\n- Discard bruised/damaged/discoloured or mouldy foods.\n- Discard foods with off smells or unusual taste.\n- Consume only mushrooms/wild plants positively identified as safe.\nBalanced diets typically keep toxin levels below harmful thresholds.\n\n**WHO response:**\nWHO/FAO assess natural toxin risks via JECFA, informing Codex standards for maximum levels and risk management. JECFA establishes tolerable intake levels or other guidance (e.g., Margin of Exposure) and advises on analytical methods, monitoring, and control. WHO urges national authorities to monitor and keep toxin levels as low as feasible, ensuring compliance with national/international limits and safeguarding food security/nutrition.","category":"Food Safety","tags":["natural toxins","food safety","JECFA","Codex","WHO"],"source":"WHO","url":"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/natural-toxins-in-food","year":2023}

{"id":"DOC_146","title":"Type 1 diabetes treatment","body":"**Main treatments:**\nNewly diagnosed people are initially managed in hospital by a specialist diabetes team, who teach ongoing self-management. Insulin therapy is essential to control blood glucose. Patients learn to keep glucose within target ranges by monitoring levels and adjusting insulin doses, often through carbohydrate counting. Care plans cover insulin selection and dosing schedules, blood glucose targets, regular HbA1c reviews (2–4 times/year), hypo/hyper awareness and management, lifestyle guidance (diet, alcohol, driving, exercise, sick-day rules), complication screening, and wellbeing support. Equipment (e.g., glucose meters, insulin delivery tools) is provided, and regular follow-up appointments are scheduled.\n\n**Insulin:**\nMultiple insulin types are taken at different times. Doses are calculated and delivered via injections (pens) several times daily or via insulin pumps. Excess insulin can cause hypoglycaemia; patients are trained to recognise and treat hypos. Insulin regimens are individualised. People with type 1 diabetes qualify for free prescriptions in the UK.\n\n**Insulin pumps:**\nContinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion devices reduce hypos and improve glucose control. Eligibility on the NHS includes inability to meet HbA1c targets without severe hypos or persistently high HbA1c despite optimal management; pumps are recommended for children under 12 who struggle with multiple daily injections.\n\n**Hybrid closed loop systems:**\nSome pumps integrate with continuous glucose monitors (CGM) to automate insulin dosing. These systems lessen hypos, improve glucose control, and reduce management burden. Availability on the NHS is expanding, with priority for individuals under 18, those pregnant/planning pregnancy, or those not achieving control with pump or CGM alone.\n\n**Appointments and tests:**\nAt least annual diabetes check-ups (more frequent initially) include HbA1c (past 8–12 weeks), weight/BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, kidney and thyroid function, and mental wellbeing assessments. Additional routine care includes HbA1c tests every 3–6 months, diabetic eye screening every 1–2 years, and annual foot checks. Children under 12 may require fewer tests.\n\n**Diabetes courses:**\nEducation programmes (free within 1 year of diagnosis) build confidence and self-management skills. Options include DAFNE (Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating) and BERTIE Diabetes (online). Courses cover insulin adjustment, diet, and practical living strategies.\n","category":"Chronic Conditions","tags":["type 1 diabetes","insulin","insulin pumps","closed loop","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-1-diabetes/treatment/","year":2024}

Symptoms can appear gradually and may be absent in some individuals. Presentation overlaps with type 1 diabetes, but type 1 typically develops faster and is more common in younger people.\n\n**Risk factors:**\nHigher risk if you’re white and over 40 years old, or over 25 from South Asian, Chinese, Black African, or Black Caribbean backgrounds. Family history (parent or sibling), overweight/low physical activity, and certain conditions (e.g., high blood pressure) increase risk. Though less common in children, ethnicity, weight, activity, and family history contribute to pediatric risk too.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nConsult a GP if you or your child have symptoms or risk factors. Routine checks are important because many people have no symptoms. Diabetes UK’s Know Your Risk tool and free NHS Health Checks (ages 40–74 without existing conditions) help assess risk for diabetes and other health issues.\n\n**Diagnosis:**\nA blood test measures glucose levels; results typically arrive in a few days. Additional tests differentiate type 1 from type 2 diabetes. Discuss questions about testing and next steps with healthcare professionals.\n\n**If diagnosed with type 2 diabetes:**\nThe diagnosis can feel overwhelming, but your diabetes care team (doctors, nurses, other professionals) can address treatment questions and ongoing management.\n\n**Prediabetes:**\nPrediabetes signifies elevated blood glucose not yet reaching diabetic levels, raising future risk. Many people lack classic symptoms. Focus on healthy eating, physical activity, and lifestyle changes to prevent progression; work with your care team for tailored guidance.\n\n**Education courses:**\nProgrammes like DESMOND (Diabetes Education for Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed) and X-PERT Health support patients and families with knowledge and skills for type 2 diabetes management.\n","category":"Chronic Conditions","tags":["type 2 diabetes","symptoms","diagnosis","prediabetes","NHS"],"source":"NHS","url":"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms/","year":2025}

Although usually not serious, they are slow to treat and often affect toenails, occasionally fingernails.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Discolouration (yellow/white patches)\n- Thickening and brittleness\n- Crumbling edges or lifting from the nail bed\n- Swelling or pain around the nail in severe cases\n\n**Pharmacy care:**\nPharmacists can advise on topical antifungal nail treatments applied daily or weekly for 6–12 months. These aren’t suitable for everyone (e.g., under 18s, pregnant or breastfeeding people). Improvement is seen as healthy nail regrows from the base.\n\n**When to see a GP:**\nSeek medical advice if infection is severe, spreads to other nails, or if you have diabetes or a weakened immune system (e.g., post-transplant, chemotherapy). GP assessment is also advised when pharmacy treatments fail.\n\n**Medical treatment:**\nGPs may prescribe oral antifungal tablets after confirming the infection type via nail sampling (and possibly blood tests). Treatment can last up to six months and may cause side effects (headache, rash, stomach upset, nausea, diarrhoea). Tablets are unsuitable for some people (liver/kidney disease, pregnancy, breastfeeding). Severely affected nails might require surgical removal under local anaesthetic.\n\n**Prevention tips:**\n- Treat athlete’s foot promptly\n- Keep nails short, feet clean and dry\n- Wear clean socks, well-fitting shoes, and flip-flops in communal showers\n- Discard old footwear\n- Avoid shoes that trap heat, and don’t share towels, footwear, or nail tools\n\nPersistent warmth and dampness (e.g., prolonged trainer use) raise infection risk.
