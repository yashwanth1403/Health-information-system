  "body": "**Overview:**\nGingivitis is a common, mild form of gum (periodontal) disease. It causes irritation, redness, swelling and bleeding of the gingiva—the gum tissue around the base of the teeth. Gingivitis itself doesn’t cause bone loss, but if untreated it can progress to periodontitis and lead to tooth loss. The most common cause is inadequate oral hygiene. Brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and seeing a dentist regularly can help prevent or reverse gingivitis.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nHealthy gums are firm, pale pink and fit snugly around teeth. Signs of gingivitis include swollen or puffy gums; bright red or dark red gums; gums that bleed easily during brushing or flossing; tenderness; and bad breath.\n\n**When to see a dentist:**\nIf you notice symptoms of gingivitis, schedule a dental visit promptly. Early treatment improves the chances of reversing the disease and preventing periodontitis. If symptoms don’t improve, a dentist may refer you to a periodontist—an expert in gum diseases.",
