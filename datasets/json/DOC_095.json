  "body": "**Overview:**\nSjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder defined by dry eyes and dry mouth caused by immune attack on moisture-secreting glands. It often coexists with other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Although it can appear at any age, most diagnoses occur after age 40 and women are affected far more often. Treatment centers on symptom relief.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Dry eyes that burn, itch, or feel gritty\n- Dry mouth that feels cottony and makes swallowing or speaking difficult\n- Joint pain, swelling, or stiffness\n- Swollen salivary glands near the jaw and ears\n- Skin rashes or dry skin\n- Vaginal dryness\n- Persistent dry cough\n- Prolonged fatigue\n\n**Causes:**\nSjogren's is an autoimmune disease in which immune cells attack glands producing tears and saliva. Genetic susceptibility plus triggers such as infections may initiate the response. The immune attack can also involve joints, thyroid, kidneys, liver, lungs, skin, and nerves.\n\n**Risk factors:**\n- Age over 40 years\n- Female sex\n- Existing rheumatic disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)\n\n**Complications:**\nCommon issues include dental cavities, oral yeast infections, and vision problems (light sensitivity, blurred vision, corneal damage) due to lack of saliva and tears. Less common complications involve lungs, kidneys, or liver (pneumonia, bronchitis, renal dysfunction, hepatitis, cirrhosis), lymph nodes (increased lymphoma risk), and nerves (peripheral neuropathy with numbness, tingling, or burning).",
