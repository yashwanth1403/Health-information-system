  "title": "Chronic sinusitis",
  "body": "**Overview:**\nChronic sinusitis (chronic rhinosinusitis) is long-lasting inflammation and swelling of the sinus cavities that persists for 12 weeks or longer despite treatment. It blocks mucus drainage, causes nasal stuffiness and makes breathing through the nose difficult. Infection, nasal polyps and chronic tissue swelling can all contribute. The condition affects both adults and children.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nCommon signs include thick, discolored nasal mucus; postnasal drip; persistent nasal congestion; pain, tenderness or swelling around the eyes, cheeks, nose or forehead; and reduced sense of smell and taste. Other symptoms may involve ear pain, headaches, aching teeth, cough, sore throat, bad breath and fatigue. Unlike acute sinusitis, fever is uncommon in chronic cases.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nSchedule an appointment for repeated sinusitis episodes, symptoms that last more than 10 days or situations where treatment isn’t helping. Seek urgent medical care for possible serious infection if you develop fever, swelling or redness around the eyes, severe headache, forehead swelling, confusion, double vision or other vision changes, or a stiff neck.",
