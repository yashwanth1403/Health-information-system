  "body": "Menopause marks the permanent end of menstrual periods—diagnosed after 12 consecutive months without bleeding—and typically occurs between the 40s and 50s (average age 51 in the U.S.), bringing natural hormonal shifts that may disrupt sleep, energy and mood but can be managed with lifestyle steps or medical therapy.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Perimenopause (menopausal transition) lasts roughly 2–8 years with fluctuating hormones that cause irregular or skipped periods, vaginal dryness, hot flashes, night sweats, sleep issues, mood changes and brain fog\n- Periods may pause for months before stopping entirely; pregnancy remains possible during perimenopause, so take a pregnancy test if uncertain\n- Any vaginal bleeding after menopause should be evaluated\n\n**Causes**\n- Natural hormone decline: ovaries slowly produce less estrogen and progesterone from the late 30s onward, ending periods around age 51\n- Surgical removal of ovaries (oophorectomy) triggers immediate menopause; hysterectomy without ovary removal stops periods but hormones continue temporarily\n- Chemotherapy or pelvic/abdominal/lower spine radiation can bring on menopause symptoms during or after treatment (periods may occasionally return)\n- Primary ovarian insufficiency affects about 1% before age 40 when ovaries underproduce hormones due to gene or autoimmune causes; hormone therapy often continues until typical menopause age to protect the brain, heart and bones\n- Age, ovary-removal surgery and certain cancer therapies are key risk factors\n\n**Prevention**\n- Menopause itself cannot be prevented, but symptom management options include:\n  - Hormone therapy (estrogen with progestin if uterus intact) to reduce hot flashes and bone loss, ideally at the lowest effective dose near menopause onset\n  - Vaginal estrogen creams, tablets or rings plus prasterone (Intrarosa) to ease dryness and pain with intercourse\n  - Nonhormonal medicines: low-dose SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, clonidine, fezolinetant (Veozah), oxybutynin\n  - Osteoporosis medicines and vitamin D for bone protection, and ospemifene for painful intercourse (avoid with breast cancer risk)\n- Review treatment choices regularly with a healthcare professional because needs may change over time\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Discuss symptoms, skipped periods or suspected pregnancy during perimenopause with a healthcare professional; mention bleeding after menopause promptly to rule out serious causes\n- Seek evaluation for menopause-like symptoms caused by thyroid issues (TSH testing may be used), and maintain regular wellness visits to monitor complications such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, urinary incontinence, sexual difficulties or weight gain linked to slower metabolism\n",
