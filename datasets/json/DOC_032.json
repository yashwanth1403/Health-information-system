  "body": "Your menstrual cycle offers insights into overall health, so knowing your personal pattern makes it easier to spot changes such as missed periods or unusual bleeding that warrant discussion with a healthcare professional.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Typical cycles run 21–35 days with 2–7 days of bleeding; long cycles are common soon after menstruation begins and may shorten with age\n- Periods may be light or heavy, painful or pain-free; extended-cycle pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs) or approaching menopause can alter flow and timing, and any irregular bleeding around menopause should be evaluated\n- Tracking start/end dates, flow (including clotting or pad/tampon use), bleeding between periods, pain severity, mood or behavior changes helps define what is normal for you\n\n**Causes**\n- Pregnancy or breast-feeding can delay or halt periods temporarily\n- Eating disorders, extreme weight loss or excessive exercise disrupt hormones and lead to irregular cycles\n- Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) involves irregular periods plus ovarian follicles on ultrasound\n- Premature ovarian failure (primary ovarian insufficiency) causes irregular or occasional periods before age 40\n- Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) results from reproductive-organ infection and may cause irregular bleeding\n- Uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths) can trigger heavy, prolonged periods\n\n**Prevention**\n- Track cycles consistently to recognize deviations; note flow changes, pain, mood shifts and external factors (stress, new medications)\n- Birth control pills can regulate cycles, while progestin-containing devices may lighten flow and ease cramps\n- Treating underlying conditions (for example, eating disorders) may restore regularity, though some irregularities cannot be prevented; approaching menopause naturally causes renewed variability\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Seek medical advice if periods stop for 90+ days without pregnancy, formerly regular cycles become irregular, bleeding exceeds seven days, flow soaks more than one pad/tampon every hour or two, cycles occur more often than every 21 days or less often than every 35 days, bleeding happens between periods, period pain becomes severe, or fever and illness follow tampon use\n- Discuss any irregular bleeding around menopause to rule out uterine cancer risk as hormone levels change with age\n",
