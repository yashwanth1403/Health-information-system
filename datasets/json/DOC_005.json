  "body": "Mental health is a state of well-being that lets people cope with life’s stresses, realize their abilities, learn and work effectively, and contribute to their communities, making it intrinsic to overall health.\n\n**Causes**\n- Combined individual, family, community and structural pressures can undermine mental health\n- Adverse circumstances such as poverty, violence, disability and inequality increase the risk of developing a mental health condition\n- Under-resourced health systems, poor-quality care, stigma, discrimination and human rights violations further worsen mental health outcomes\n\n**Prevention**\n- Countries are pursuing the WHO Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (2013–2030), which emphasizes governance, community-based care, and coordinated promotion and prevention strategies\n- WHO initiatives like the World Mental Health Report, the Special Initiative for Mental Health and mhGAP support nations in scaling up affordable services and community networks focused on prevention and early support\n",
