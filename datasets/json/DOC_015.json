  "body": "A heart attack (myocardial infarction) happens when blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked, usually by a clot, and it is a life-threatening emergency that requires rapid treatment to limit damage.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Chest pain or pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across the chest\n- Pain spreading to the arms (often the left but possibly both), jaw, neck, back or tummy\n- Lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating or shortness of breath\n- Nausea, vomiting, coughing, wheezing or overwhelming anxiety similar to a panic attack\n- Some people experience only milder discomfort resembling indigestion, or symptoms such as breathlessness, sickness or back/jaw pain without chest pain\n\n**Causes**\n- Coronary heart disease, where fatty plaques clog the coronary arteries\n- Plaque rupture triggers a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart muscle, causing the heart attack\n\n**Prevention**\n- Quit smoking and limit alcohol intake\n- Maintain a healthy weight, eat a low-fat, high-fibre diet with wholegrains plus at least five portions of fruit and vegetables daily\n- Do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise each week (unless your doctor advises otherwise)\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Call emergency services (999) and request an ambulance immediately if a heart attack is suspected—the faster the response, the better the outcome\n- While waiting for help, chewing and swallowing a 300 mg aspirin tablet (if not allergic) can help thin the blood\n",
