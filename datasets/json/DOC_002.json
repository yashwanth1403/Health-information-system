  "body": "**About the condition:**\n- Hypertension (high blood pressure) occurs when blood flowing through vessels exerts persistently elevated force, making the heart work harder.\n- It is a serious, often silent condition that raises the risk of heart, brain, kidney, and other diseases, contributing to premature deaths worldwide and disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Many people are asymptomatic, but signs can include early morning headaches, nosebleeds, irregular heart rhythms, vision changes, and buzzing in the ears.\n- Severe stages may lead to fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anxiety, chest pain, and muscle tremors; untreated hypertension can trigger angina, heart attacks, heart failure, arrhythmias, or sudden death.\n\n**Causes/Risk factors:**\n- Modifiable factors: high salt intake, diets rich in saturated and trans fats, low fruit and vegetable consumption, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, being overweight or obese, and prolonged exposure to air pollution.\n- Non-modifiable factors: family history of hypertension, age over 65, and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease.\n\n**Prevention/Management:**\n- Reduce modifiable risks through healthier diets, increased physical activity, weight management, quitting tobacco, limiting alcohol, and minimizing air-pollution exposure when possible.\n- Manage mental stress, monitor blood pressure regularly (at home or with a health professional), and treat high blood pressure alongside any other medical conditions.\n",
