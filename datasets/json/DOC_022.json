  "body": "Chickenpox is a highly contagious infection that mostly affects children, causes an itchy rash with feverish symptoms, usually settles within 1 to 2 weeks, but can become serious for pregnant people, newborns and anyone with a weakened immune system.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Itchy, spotty rash that can appear anywhere on the body; fever, aches, pains and loss of appetite may occur before or after the rash\n- Stage 1 (spots): lesions may appear inside the mouth or around the genitals, spread or stay localized, and look red, pink, darker or similar to surrounding skin (harder to see on brown or black skin)\n- Stage 2 (blisters): fluid-filled blisters become very itchy and may burst\n- Stage 3 (scabs): spots form flaky or leaking scabs while new spots can still appear\n\n**Causes**\n- Infection with the varicella-zoster virus spreads from 2 days before spots appear until all have scabbed (about 5 days after they first show)\n- Transmission occurs through being in the same room as an infected person, touching contaminated objects, or contact with someone who has shingles if you've never had chickenpox (shingles itself is not caught from chickenpox)\n\n**Prevention**\n- Stay away from school, nursery or work until all spots have scabbed (usually 5 days) to avoid spreading the virus, especially to newborns, pregnant people or immunocompromised individuals\n- Home care to ease symptoms and limit complications: drink plenty of fluids (ice lollies for reluctant children), take paracetamol for pain, trim nails and cover hands with socks at night to prevent scratching, use pharmacy cooling creams/gels or antihistamines for itching, bathe in cool water and pat dry, wear loose clothing, and avoid scratching to reduce scarring\n- Avoid ibuprofen unless a doctor advises it, never give aspirin to under-16s, and steer clear of vulnerable groups while contagious\n- NHS chickenpox vaccination is available when there is a risk of passing the virus to someone with weakened immunity (e.g., a parent on chemotherapy); private clinics also offer the vaccine for £120–£200\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Contact a GP if unsure about the diagnosis or concerned about your/your child's symptoms, and inform the surgery beforehand if you suspect chickenpox\n- Call NHS 111 urgently if symptoms suddenly worsen, dehydration signs appear (such as fewer wet nappies), the skin around blisters becomes hot, painful or red (redness may be harder to see on brown or black skin), or if you are breastfeeding, pregnant without prior chickenpox, immunocompromised, have a newborn affected/exposed, or were near someone with chickenpox/shingles\n- Some high-risk people may need antiviral medicine within 24 hours of spots appearing to prevent complications\n",
