  "body": "**Overview:**\nRoughly two-thirds of body weight is water, making fluids essential for cellular function, bodily fluids (saliva, blood, urine, sweat, joint fluid), and overall survival. Water loss occurs through sweat, bathroom use, and breathing, so daily intake must replace losses to avoid dehydration.\n\n**Dehydration signs and risks:**\nEarly warnings include intense thirst, headaches, dry mouth or skin, and dark urine. Severe dehydration can cause confusion, fainting, inability to urinate, and rapid heartbeat and breathing—situations requiring urgent medical care and possibly intravenous fluids.\n\n**Long-term health impact:**\nNIH research links chronic underhydration in middle age to higher risks of heart failure, diabetes, chronic lung disease, dementia, faster aging, and earlier death. Staying well hydrated may support healthier aging.\n\n**Daily fluid guidance:**\nWater and low-calorie drinks (plain coffee or tea, sparkling or flavored water, milk or alternatives, 100% vegetable juice) are preferred sources. Sugary sodas or sports drinks add calories with limited value. Needs vary by age, location, and body weight, and increase with exercise, hot weather, illness, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or medications that increase urination. Experts suggest about 9 cups of fluids daily for women and 13 cups for men on average.\n\n**Personal strategies:**\nNIH researcher Dr. Natalia Dmitrieva now carries a liter of water to work daily to ensure adequate intake—a simple tactic anyone can adopt.\n\n**Wise Choices: Staying hydrated:**\n- Drink when thirsty—and proactively during the day\n- Choose water or low-calorie beverages; carry a refillable bottle\n- Drink at routine times (with meals) and around physical activity\n- Increase fluids during hot weather or illness\n- Seek medical help for confusion, fainting, rapid heartbeat or breathing, or inability to urinate\n\nMaintaining regular fluid intake supports organ function, limits dehydration risks, and may reduce the likelihood of chronic disease and premature aging.",
