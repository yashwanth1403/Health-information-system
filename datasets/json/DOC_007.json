  "body": "Nutrition underpins health and development by supporting infant, child and maternal outcomes, strengthening immunity, enabling safer pregnancy and childbirth, lowering noncommunicable disease risk, and fostering productivity, economic growth and longevity.\n\n**Causes**\n- Malnutrition takes multiple forms: undernutrition (wasting, stunting), micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, obesity and diet-related NCDs\n- Low- and middle-income countries face a dual burden of undernutrition and obesity, with undernutrition linked to about 45% of deaths among children under 5\n- Limited exclusive breastfeeding (only 44% of infants under 6 months) and high sodium intake beyond the 5 g/day recommendation contribute to poor nutritional outcomes\n\n**Prevention**\n- WHO's 2016–2025 nutrition strategy and related frameworks (maternal, infant and young child nutrition plan; NCD global action plan; women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health strategy) guide evidence-based policies and interventions\n- Global priorities include reducing salt intake and eliminating industrially produced trans fats from the food supply to curb diet-related diseases\n- Breastfeeding promotion and comprehensive nutrition programmes aim to break the cycle of malnutrition across populations\n",
