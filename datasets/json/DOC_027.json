  "body": "Most coughs clear on their own within 3 to 4 weeks, and self-care usually manages the symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Persistent coughing that may include hacking fits, difficulty stopping, chest discomfort, swollen neck glands, breathlessness, or coughing up mucus/blood (these features can signal more serious illness)\n- Systemic effects such as fever, feeling very unwell, or unexplained weight loss may accompany a cough\n\n**Causes**\n- Commonly triggered by colds or flu\n- Other causes include smoking, heartburn (acid reflux), allergies such as hay fever, infections like bronchitis or COVID-19, and post-nasal drip; rarely, a cough indicates something serious such as lung cancer\n\n**Prevention**\n- Rest, stay hydrated, and remain at home if feverish or too unwell for normal activities\n- Manage discomfort with paracetamol or ibuprofen; try hot lemon and honey (not for babies under 1) or pelargonium for those aged 12+, understanding the evidence is limited and checking suitability (especially if pregnant)\n- Pharmacy options such as cough syrups, medicines (avoid codeine-based products in children under 12) and cough sweets may reduce coughing frequency; decongestants and codeine mixtures do not stop coughs\n- Prepare hot lemon and honey by mixing half a lemon and 1–2 teaspoons of honey in boiled water and drinking warm (avoid hot drinks for small children)\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- See a GP if a cough lasts longer than 3 weeks, you lose weight without explanation, or you have a weakened immune system (e.g., due to chemotherapy or diabetes)\n- Seek urgent GP/111 help if the cough is severe or rapidly worsening, you feel very unwell, have chest pain, painful swollen neck glands, breathing difficulties, or cough up blood\n- During appointments, GPs may listen to the chest, examine mucus samples, order X-rays, allergy or lung function tests, or rarely refer to a specialist; antibiotics are only given when clearly needed (such as confirmed bacterial infection or high complication risk)\n",
