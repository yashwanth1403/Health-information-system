  "title": "What to do if Someone has a Seizure (Fit)",
  "body": "Seeing someone have a seizure (fit) can be alarming, but calm, simple actions help keep them safe until it stops.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Warning signs you might observe: unusual sensations (smell or taste), mood changes, sudden noises (falling) or movements (eyes rolling, head turning) before convulsions begin\n- During a seizure, the person may stiffen, jerk or twitch in specific body areas, change colour (paler, flushed, blue or grey; on brown or black skin check palms, soles, lips, gums, inside eyelids), lose consciousness or awareness, have altered breathing, mumble, wander or fumble, bite their tongue, lose bladder or bowel control, or experience a febrile-type fit\n- Afterward they may be drowsy, need to sleep, or feel confused; note how long recovery takes\n\n**Prevention**\n- During the seizure: move the person only if in danger (busy road, hot cooker), cushion their head, loosen tight neck clothing, and after convulsions stop turn them onto their side; if seated in a wheelchair, apply brakes, keep seatbelts/harnesses fastened, support and cushion the head without moving them\n- Stay with them, speak calmly, time the seizure from start to finish, and keep food, drink, fingers or objects away from their mouth until fully recovered\n- Gather useful details for their doctor: what they were doing beforehand, whether the seizure began without warning, breathing patterns, body parts involved, colour changes, duration, injuries, and whether they slept afterward\n- People with epilepsy may carry care plans, emergency medicines, bracelets or cards—follow their plan if you are trained, and maintaining a seizure diary can help track events\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Call 999 for an ambulance if it is the person’s first seizure, lasts longer than usual or beyond 5 minutes, repeats without regaining consciousness, or recovery is incomplete; also call if they are seriously injured or struggle to breathe afterward\n- Not every seizure requires hospital care (many people with epilepsy manage at home), but emergency help is vital in the situations above\n",
