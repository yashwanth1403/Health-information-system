  "body": "Schizophrenia is a chronic mental health condition that causes psychosis, substantial disability and wide-ranging impacts on personal, family, social, educational and occupational life; about 23 million people worldwide live with it, more than two thirds of those with psychosis receive no specialist care, and stigma, discrimination, human rights violations and shortened life expectancy remain pervasive despite effective treatments that enable at least one in three people to recover fully.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Marked changes in perception, thinking, behaviour and affect, including persistent delusions (fixed false beliefs), hallucinations (perceiving stimuli that are not present) and experiences of influence or control over thoughts or actions\n- Disorganized thinking (jumbled or irrelevant speech) and disorganized behaviour that can appear bizarre or purposeless\n- Negative symptoms such as very limited speech, restricted emotional expression, inability to feel interest or pleasure, social withdrawal, extreme agitation, slowed movements or rigid postures\n- Cognitive difficulties with memory, attention and problem-solving are common; symptom courses vary from complete remission to alternating exacerbations and remissions or gradual worsening\n- The condition causes significant distress, functional impairment, and higher rates of physical illness, premature mortality (on average nine years earlier) and vulnerability during emergencies that disrupt social supports and health services\n\n**Causes**\n- No single cause is known; schizophrenia likely results from interactions between genetic susceptibility and environmental influences, while psychosocial factors shape onset and course\n- Contributing factors under study include heavy cannabis use, prenatal and perinatal complications, infections, stress and social determinants; these add to existing stigma, restricted opportunities and human rights abuses that limit access to health care, education, housing and employment\n\n**Prevention**\n- Improving access to community-based mental health services, integrating care into primary and general health systems, providing supported housing/employment, and involving people with lived experience help reduce neglect, abuse and exclusion\n- WHO initiatives such as the Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2030, the Special Initiative for Mental Health, the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) and the QualityRights Project promote rights-based, recovery-oriented services that shift resources from institutional settings to person-centred community care\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Individuals experiencing psychosis symptoms—or their families—should seek professional assessment so evidence-based treatments (antipsychotic medicines, psychoeducation, family interventions, cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychosocial rehabilitation, assisted living, supported employment) can be coordinated through collaborative, rights-respecting services\n",
