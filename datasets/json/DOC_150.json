  "body": "Kidney stones are hard deposits that form in one or both kidneys, most common between ages 30 and 60, and affect over 1 in 10 people. They can reside in the kidneys or ureter (the tube to the bladder). Left untreated, stones can cause severe pain, infections, or kidney impairment.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nSmall stones may pass unnoticed. Larger stones can cause side abdominal pain, severe intermittent pain, and nausea or vomiting.\n\n**Urgent medical help:**\nContact a GP or NHS 111 if you experience severe pain, fever/shivering, or blood in urine.\n\n**Causes:**\nWaste products in blood can crystallize in kidneys, forming stones over time. Risks increase with inadequate fluid intake, certain medications, or medical conditions that elevate specific urine substances.\n\n**Treatment and prevention:**\nMany stones pass naturally with urine; symptoms can often be managed at home with medication. Larger stones may require surgical removal or fragmentation. Up to half of individuals may have recurrence within five years. Preventive strategies include staying well hydrated and keeping urine pale to dilute waste products.\n\n**Kidney function:**\nKidneys are bean-shaped organs (~10 cm) located toward the back of the abdomen on either side of the spine. They filter waste from blood, returning clean blood to circulation and eliminating waste through urine.",
