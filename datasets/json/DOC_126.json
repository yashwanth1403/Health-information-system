  "body": "**Overview:**\nThe body has an internal network of biological clocks that governs daily circadian rhythms—patterns in sleep, alertness, appetite, and other key functions. A master clock in the brain receives signals from the eyes and coordinates clocks throughout the body. Daylight cues prompt hormone releases that boost alertness and energy, while evening darkness triggers melatonin production for sleep. Keeping these rhythms synchronized is vital for health.\n\n**How rhythms work:**\nCircadian rhythms, driven by clock genes, influence body temperature, blood pressure, activity levels, inflammation, fertility, mood, and brain function. Timing of health events can align with these rhythms; for example, heart attacks occur more often in early morning when cortisol rises.\n\n**Metabolism and timing:**\nCircadian rhythms affect eating habits, digestion, and metabolism. Eating later in the day—close to melatonin release—can disrupt rhythms, leading to increased body fat and higher risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Time of day also affects how well medications work and their side effects, including cancer therapies.\n\n**Disruptors:**\nModern lifestyles can desynchronize internal clocks:\n- **Shift work:** Working at night conflicts with natural rhythms, causing fatigue at work, daytime sleep difficulty, and higher risks of heart disease, digestive issues, cancer, and depression.\n- **Jet lag:** Crossing time zones causes misalignment because the brain struggles to adapt rapidly to new day-night cycles.\n- **Around-the-clock schedules:** Light exposure, irregular meals, and varied sleep patterns challenge circadian alignment.\n\n**Research and future directions:**\nScientists investigate optimal timing for treatments, surgeries, and behaviors to align with body clocks. This work may lead to improved strategies for managing insomnia, jet lag, diabetes, and other rhythm-related disorders.\n\n**Wise choices to keep clocks on track:**\n- Maintain a consistent sleep schedule every day.\n- Sleep in a dark, quiet, comfortable environment.\n- Avoid heavy meals two to three hours before bedtime.\n- Limit caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol late in the day.\n- Exercise daily, but finish at least two hours before bedtime.\n- Reduce exposure to bright screens before sleep.\n\nProtecting circadian rhythms through sleep hygiene, light management, and regular routines supports overall health and reduces risks tied to clock disruption.",
