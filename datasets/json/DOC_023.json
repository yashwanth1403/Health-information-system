  "body": "Hair loss is common and often harmless, though losing hair can feel upsetting; some types are permanent, others are temporary, and targeted treatment may help depending on the cause.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Normal shedding is 50–100 hairs a day and may go unnoticed, but noticeable thinning or bald patches can affect wellbeing and confidence\n- Male and female pattern baldness typically runs in families and can progress over time; other patterns may follow illness, stress, cancer treatment, significant weight loss or iron deficiency\n\n**Causes**\n- Permanent causes include hereditary male or female pattern baldness\n- Temporary hair loss can result from illness, stress, cancer treatment, weight loss, iron deficiency or other medical conditions\n\n**Prevention**\n- Many cases do not need treatment and either resolve as you recover or represent normal ageing, but options exist when hair loss is distressing\n- Medicines: finasteride (men only) and minoxidil (men and women) can slow pattern baldness but work only while used, are not 100% effective and may not be available on the NHS\n- Covering options: synthetic wigs (last 6–9 months, cheaper, easier care but can be hot/itchy) or real-hair wigs (last 3–4 years, more natural but costlier and harder to maintain); some NHS funding is available depending on eligibility\n- Specialist procedures available in certain clinics include steroid injections or creams for bald patches, topical or tablet immunotherapy, ultraviolet light treatment, permanent make-up (micropigmentation), hair transplants, scalp reduction surgery, and artificial hair implants; availability on the NHS varies\n- Emotional support such as counselling, support groups or online forums can help people cope with the impact of hair loss\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Visit a GP if worried about hair loss, to identify the cause, discuss wellbeing impacts and review treatment options before considering commercial hair clinics\n- Hair loss linked to medical conditions often stops or reverses after treatment, so professional assessment is useful before pursuing private treatments\n",
