  "title": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)",
  "body": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes inappropriately or weakens, allowing stomach contents to flow back into the esophagus. This reflux—acidic or sometimes nonacidic—irritates the lining of the esophagus, producing chronic symptoms commonly known as heartburn. Many people experience occasional reflux, but frequent or persistent episodes define GERD. Most cases improve with lifestyle changes and medicines, though some individuals require surgery.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Chest burning (heartburn) after meals, worse at night or when lying down.\n- Regurgitation of food or sour liquid.\n- Upper abdominal or chest pain.\n- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia).\n- Sensation of a lump in the throat.\nNighttime reflux may add chronic cough, laryngitis, or worsening asthma.\n\n**When to seek care:**\nImmediate medical attention is required for chest pain with shortness of breath or jaw/arm pain, as these could indicate a heart attack. See a healthcare professional for severe or frequent GERD symptoms or if you rely on over-the-counter heartburn medicines more than twice weekly.\n\n**Causes:**\nGERD results from recurrent acid reflux. Normally, the lower esophageal sphincter opens to allow food into the stomach and then closes. If it relaxes improperly or weakens, stomach acid flows backward, inflaming the esophageal lining and causing chronic symptoms.\n\n**Risk factors and aggravating behaviors:**\nConditions raising GERD risk include obesity, hiatal hernia, pregnancy, connective tissue disorders (e.g., scleroderma), and delayed stomach emptying. Triggers that worsen reflux include smoking, large meals or late eating, fatty or fried foods, alcohol, coffee, and certain medicines such as aspirin.\n\n**Complications:**\n- **Esophagitis:** Chronic acid exposure inflames and erodes esophageal tissue, leading to ulcers that cause pain and swallowing difficulties.\n- **Esophageal stricture:** Scar tissue from acid damage narrows the esophagus, obstructing food passage.\n- **Barrett esophagus:** Long-term acid exposure alters lower esophageal lining cells, increasing the risk of esophageal cancer.",
