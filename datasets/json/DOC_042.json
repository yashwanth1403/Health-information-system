  "title": "Epilepsy",
  "body": "Epilepsy is a chronic noncommunicable brain disease marked by recurrent, unprovoked seizures that affect people of all ages worldwide; around 50 million people live with it, nearly 80% in low- and middle-income countries, and up to 70% could be seizure-free with proper diagnosis and treatment, yet three quarters in low-income settings lack needed care while stigma, discrimination and premature mortality remain high.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Seizures may involve part of the body (partial) or the whole body (generalized), with features ranging from brief lapses in attention or muscle jerks to prolonged convulsions and possible loss of consciousness or bladder/bowel control\n- Temporary symptoms depend on the brain region affected and can include disturbances in movement, sensation, awareness, mood or cognition, as well as higher rates of physical injuries (e.g., fractures) and psychological conditions such as anxiety or depression\n- People with epilepsy have heightened risks of preventable deaths from falls, drowning, burns and prolonged seizures, especially in low- and middle-income countries\n\n**Causes**\n- Epilepsy is not contagious and arises from structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune or unknown factors\n- Examples include prenatal or perinatal brain damage (oxygen deprivation, trauma, low birth weight), congenital abnormalities or genetic conditions, severe head injuries, strokes, meningitis, encephalitis, neurocysticercosis, certain genetic syndromes and brain tumours; about half of cases have no identifiable cause\n- Global incidence is higher (up to 139 per 100 000) in low- and middle-income countries due to increased risks such as malaria, neurocysticercosis, traffic injuries and birth injuries, coupled with limited medical infrastructure\n\n**Prevention**\n- Around 25% of cases are preventable through measures such as preventing head injuries (reducing falls and traffic accidents), ensuring good perinatal care, treating fevers in children to avoid febrile seizures, reducing stroke risk (controlling blood pressure, diabetes, obesity; avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol) and preventing central nervous system infections (e.g., eliminating parasites causing neurocysticercosis)\n- Training primary health care providers, improving access to antiseizure medicines and shifting services from institutions to community-based care reduce treatment gaps and human rights abuses\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- People experiencing seizures—or caring for someone who does—should seek medical evaluation so that antiseizure medicines, psychosocial support, community mental health services or surgery (when medicines fail) can be provided, reducing injury risks, stigma and premature death\n",
