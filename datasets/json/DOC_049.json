  "title": "Adolescent Pregnancy",
  "body": "Adolescent pregnancy, defined as pregnancy in girls aged 10–19 years, remains a global public health concern with profound health, social and economic consequences. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there were an estimated 21 million pregnancies annually among adolescents aged 15–19 in 2019, half of which were unintended, resulting in about 12 million births. Approximately 55% of unintended pregnancies in adolescents end in abortions, often unsafe in LMICs. Adolescents face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than women aged 20–24, and their babies have greater risks of low birth weight, preterm birth and severe neonatal complications. While global ABR has fallen, declines are uneven across regions and within countries, with higher rates among adolescents with limited education or low socioeconomic status.\n\n**Causes**\n- Socioeconomic inequities: Adolescents with less education or low income experience higher pregnancy rates\n- Child marriage: Early marriage limits autonomy over timing of childbearing and contraceptive use\n- Limited opportunities: In settings with restricted education/employment prospects, motherhood may be one of few valued roles\n- Contraceptive barriers: Adolescents face limited availability, cost, stigma, restrictive laws (age/marital status), provider bias, side effects, and inconsistent use\n- Sexual violence: About 120 million girls under 20 have experienced sexual violence by non-partners; 1 in 8 children experience sexual abuse before 18, and 1 in 20 girls aged 15–19 report forced sex, increasing unintended pregnancies\n- Intimate partner violence: 24% of adolescent girls aged 15–19 have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner; 16% within the last year, undermining reproductive autonomy\n- Social pressures to bear children\n- Restrictive laws, provider bias, stigma, cost, and inadequate information\n\n**Prevention**\n- Strategies increasingly couple pregnancy prevention with improved access to respectful, high-quality maternal care and support for pregnant adolescents\n- Preventing adolescent pregnancy aligns with SDG indicators 3.7.2 (adolescent birth rate) and 5.3.1 (child marriage)\n- National programmes targeting adolescent pregnancy prevention and child marriage reduction",
