  "body": "Malnutrition covers deficiencies, excesses or imbalances of energy and nutrients, ranging from undernutrition and micronutrient problems to overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases that impact people worldwide, particularly children under five and populations in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n**Causes**\n- Undernutrition: wasting (acute weight loss), stunting (chronic low height-for-age) and underweight, often driven by inadequate food intake, infections and poor caregiving environments\n- Micronutrient-related malnutrition: deficiencies or excesses of vitamins and minerals such as iodine, vitamin A and iron that impair growth and development\n- Overweight and obesity: energy-dense diets high in sugars and fats combined with reduced physical activity leading to excessive fat accumulation, increased BMI and diet-related NCDs like cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and diabetes\n- Poverty and inequity that limit access to nutritious foods, healthcare and supportive environments, making women, infants, children and adolescents especially vulnerable\n",
