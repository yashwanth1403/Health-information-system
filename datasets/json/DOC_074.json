  "body": "**Key Facts:**\nGetting enough sleep supports students’ overall health and well-being. Adequate nightly sleep helps students stay focused, improves concentration, and boosts academic performance. Good sleep hygiene, combined with later school start times, helps adolescents stay healthier and perform better academically.\n\n**Overview:**\nChildren and adolescents who do not get enough sleep are at higher risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, poor mental health, and injuries. Insufficient sleep is also linked to attention and behavior problems, leading to poorer school performance.\n\n**Sleep needs by age:**\nThe American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends:\n- **Ages 6–12:** 9–12 hours of sleep per 24 hours\n- **Ages 13–18:** 8–10 hours of sleep per 24 hours\n\n**Insufficient sleep among students:**\n2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys found:\n- **Middle school (grades 6–8) students in 9 states:** 57.8% did not get enough sleep on school nights.\n- **High school (grades 9–12) students nationwide:** 72.7% did not get enough sleep on school nights.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nIn 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that middle and high schools start no earlier than 8:30 AM so adolescents can get the sleep they need. The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and other medical organizations also support delaying school start times for adolescents.",
