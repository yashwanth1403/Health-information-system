  "title": "Water: How Much Should You Drink?",
  "body": "Water is essential to health, making up about 50% to 70% of body weight and supporting every cell, tissue and organ by removing waste, regulating temperature, cushioning joints and protecting tissues. Dehydration occurs when fluid intake is insufficient and even mild dehydration can cause fatigue. Daily fluid needs vary with health, activity level and environment, but the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend about 15.5 cups (3.7 liters) of fluids per day for men and 11.5 cups (2.7 liters) for women, including water, other beverages and foods (which typically contribute about 20% of intake). The “eight glasses a day” guideline is reasonable for many people, but needs should be adjusted for exercise (extra fluids before, during and after activity), hot or humid weather, high altitude, illness (fever, vomiting, diarrhea), certain medical conditions (bladder infections, urinary tract stones) and pregnancy or breastfeeding. Hydration can come from water-rich foods (fruits, vegetables) and beverages such as milk, juice and herbal tea; even caffeinated drinks contribute, though sugary beverages should be limited due to excess calories. Adequate hydration is indicated by infrequent thirst and pale urine. To stay hydrated, drink water with each meal and between meals, before/during/after exercise, and whenever thirsty. Drinking too much water is uncommon but can occur, especially in athletes overcompensating; excess intake can dilute blood sodium and cause hyponatremia, which is potentially life-threatening.",
