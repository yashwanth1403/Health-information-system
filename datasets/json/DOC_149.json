  "body": "Jet lag occurs when long flights disrupt your normal sleep pattern. Symptoms usually improve within a few days as your body adjusts to the new time zone.\n\n**Reducing jet lag:**\n- Rest well before travel; gradually shift your sleep schedule toward the destination time zone.\n- **During flights:** Stay hydrated, move around regularly, try sleeping if it’s nighttime at your destination, and use eye masks or earplugs if helpful. Avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol.\n- **After arrival:** Align sleep with local time quickly, set alarms to prevent oversleeping, and get daylight exposure to reset your body clock. Avoid daytime naps—sleep only at night. For short trips (2–3 days), consider keeping your home schedule to avoid repeated adjustments.\n\n**Treatment:**\nMedications are usually unnecessary. Jet lag typically resolves as circadian rhythms realign. Short-term sleeping tablets may help severe insomnia but carry dependency risks. Melatonin tablets aren’t recommended on the NHS due to insufficient evidence.\n\n**Symptoms:**\nDifficulty sleeping at the correct times, daytime fatigue, poor sleep quality, decreased concentration/memory, and sometimes indigestion, nausea, constipation, appetite changes, or mild anxiety.",
