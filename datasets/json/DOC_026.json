  "body": "Constipation means pooing less often than usual, passing hard or lumpy poo, or struggling to empty the bowels; it is common at all ages and usually improves with straightforward diet and lifestyle changes (this guidance is for adults).\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Fewer than 3 poos in a week or pooing less often than normal\n- Stool that is unusually large or small, dry, hard or lumpy, causing straining or pain and a feeling that the bowels have not fully emptied\n- Possible stomach ache, bloating or feeling sick; behaviour changes such as confusion may hint at constipation in older adults or people with dementia or learning disability\n\n**Causes**\n- Too little dietary fibre (fruit, vegetables, cereals) or insufficient fluids\n- Low physical activity, long periods sitting or lying down, or ignoring the urge to poo\n- Changes in diet or routine; side effects of medicines (including opioid painkillers); stress, anxiety or depression\n- Pregnancy, the postnatal period, older age (over 65) and rare medical conditions such as diverticular disease or bowel cancer\n\n**Prevention**\n- Diet: eat a healthy balanced diet, gradually increase fibre, and choose sorbitol-containing fruits (apples, apricots, grapes/raisins, raspberries, strawberries); add wheat bran, oats or linseed; stay well hydrated and avoid alcohol\n- Toilet habits: keep a regular time and give yourself enough privacy; respond promptly to the urge to poo; use a low stool to raise knees above hips when on the toilet\n- Activity: incorporate daily walks or runs and stay generally active\n- Pharmacy support: if lifestyle steps are not enough, ask a pharmacist to recommend a short-course laxative (most work within 3 days)\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Consult a GP if constipation persists despite self-care, recurs frequently, or is accompanied by bloating, tiredness, tummy pain, blood in poo, unexplained weight loss, sudden changes in bowel habits, or constipation linked to prescribed medicines (speak to the GP before stopping any medicine)\n- Seek medical help for signs of faecal impaction (diarrhoea leaking around a blockage), as treatment may include stronger laxatives, suppositories, mini enemas or manual removal by a healthcare professional\n",
