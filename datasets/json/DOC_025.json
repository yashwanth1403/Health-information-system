  "body": "Hearing loss becomes more common with age but can affect anyone; many causes are treatable, so see a GP if you notice changes or others mention difficulties.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Difficulty hearing people clearly, misunderstanding speech (especially in noisy settings) or needing higher TV/music volume\n- Trouble following phone calls or conversations, frequently asking others to repeat themselves, or feeling tired/stressed from concentrating on listening\n- Others may notice the problem first; in children it can affect speech and school progress, and spotting signs in babies may require using the GOV.UK sound-response checklist\n\n**Causes**\n- Gradual loss in both ears often stems from ageing or long-term loud-noise exposure\n- Ear infections with earache, fever, itching, pressure or discharge; earwax build-up causing blocked sensation and itchiness (usually one ear)\n- Perforated eardrum after infections, loud sounds or sudden pressure changes; labyrinthitis or Ménière's disease causing sudden hearing loss with dizziness, vertigo or tinnitus\n\n**Prevention**\n- Address reversible causes: GPs can treat infections (antibiotics) or remove earwax with drops or extraction; specialists may recommend hearing aids or implants when loss is permanent, improving loudness and clarity\n- Manage daily life: reduce background noise during conversations, face the person speaking, ask for repetition or written notes, and explore assistive tools (phone/TV amplifiers, flashing or vibrating alarms, smartphone/tablet apps)\n- Protect remaining hearing by wearing ear protection around loud noises, keeping music volumes comfortable, and avoiding putting fingers or objects like cotton buds into ears\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Book a GP appointment if hearing seems to be getting gradually worse or if hearing has not returned after treating ear infections or earwax build-up; some pharmacies and opticians offer free hearing tests too\n- Seek urgent GP/111 help for sudden hearing loss in one or both ears, hearing that worsens over days or weeks, or hearing loss accompanied by other symptoms such as earache or discharge—early treatment may be critical\n",
