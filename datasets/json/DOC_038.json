  "body": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung condition marked by airway inflammation and damage (most often from long-term irritant exposure) that limits airflow, causes emphysema and chronic bronchitis together, and can be managed to improve quality of life while lowering heart-disease and lung-cancer risks.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Shortness of breath (especially with activity), wheezing or whistling breath sounds\n- Chronic cough producing clear, white, yellow or greenish mucus\n- Chest tightness or heaviness, fatigue, frequent lung infections\n- Unintended weight loss as COPD worsens and swelling in ankles, feet or legs\n- Exacerbations (flare-ups) bring harder breathing, more chest tightness, increased coughing, thicker mucus and fever, often triggered by smells, cold air, pollution, colds or infections\n\n**Causes**\n- Tobacco smoking is the main cause in developed countries; fumes from burning fuel for cooking/heating in poorly ventilated homes are common causes in developing regions\n- Long-term workplace exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dust, plus secondhand smoke, cigar, pipe or marijuana smoke, air pollution and other irritants\n- Genetic factors such as alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (≈1% of cases) help explain why not all smokers develop COPD; asthma combined with smoking increases risk\n- Airway obstruction arises from emphysema (damaged alveolar walls and elastic fibers trap old air) and chronic bronchitis (inflamed, narrowed bronchi with thickened walls and excess mucus)\n\n**Prevention**\n- Avoid or quit smoking to prevent or slow COPD progression\n- Limit exposure to workplace irritants by improving ventilation and using protective equipment\n- Reduce complications by staying current on flu, pneumococcal, COVID-19 and RSV vaccines and addressing mental health impacts of chronic illness\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Contact a healthcare professional if symptoms fail to improve, worsen, or signs of infection appear (fever or mucus changes)\n- Seek emergency care for severe breathlessness, blue lips or nail beds, rapid heartbeat or confusion\n",
