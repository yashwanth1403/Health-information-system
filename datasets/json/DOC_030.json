  "body": "A brain tumour is an abnormal growth of brain cells that can be low grade (grade 1–2, often benign and slower growing) or high grade (grade 3–4, cancerous, more likely to grow back); tumours may start in the brain or spread there from other sites.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Headaches that change in pattern or intensity\n- Seizures (fits)\n- Persistent nausea, vomiting or drowsiness\n- Mental or behavioural changes such as memory problems or personality shifts\n- Progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body\n- Vision or speech difficulties, with symptoms that may be absent at first or develop gradually\n\n**Causes**\n- Exact causes are often unknown, but risk increases with age (most often in adults 85–89), though some types are more common in children\n- Exposure to radiation (including previous radiotherapy or, very rarely, CT scans/X-rays of the head)\n- Family history and certain genetic conditions such as tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2, and Turner syndrome\n\n**Prevention**\n- Management focuses on tailored treatment plans based on tumour type, location, size, spread, cell abnormality and overall health; options include steroids to reduce swelling, symptom-relief medicines (anti-epileptics, painkillers), surgery to remove as much tumour as safely possible, radiotherapy and chemotherapy\n- Non-cancerous tumours are often treated successfully, but regular follow-up appointments may be needed because there is a small chance of recurrence\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Consult a GP if you develop the symptoms listed—especially headaches that differ from your usual pattern or worsen\n- If no other cause is found, you may be referred to a neurologist for further assessment, including brain scans; early evaluation helps determine appropriate treatment and outlook (about 12,000 UK residents are diagnosed with primary brain tumours annually, roughly half cancerous)\n",
