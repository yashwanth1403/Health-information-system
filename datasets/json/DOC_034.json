  "body": "Alzheimer's disease—the leading cause of dementia—results from amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles damaging brain cells, shrinking the brain and ultimately causing severe memory loss, daily-function decline and complications such as dehydration, poor nutrition or infections; about 6.9 million Americans aged 65+ (over 70% aged 75+) and an estimated 60–70% of the world’s 55 million people with dementia live with this condition, and while no cure exists, medicines plus caregiver support programs may ease symptoms or slow decline.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Memory loss starts with forgetting recent events or conversations and progresses to repeating statements or questions, forgetting appointments, misplacing items, getting lost in familiar places, and struggling to recall names of loved ones or common objects\n- Thinking and reasoning issues include trouble concentrating on abstract concepts (such as numbers), multitasking, managing finances or recognizing figures\n- Judgment and decision-making deteriorate, affecting choices about clothing, social situations or driving, and everyday problem solving\n- Planning and completing familiar multi-step tasks (cooking, games, dressing, bathing) become challenging as the disease advances\n- Personality and behavior may shift toward depression, apathy, social withdrawal, mood swings, distrust, anger, aggression, sleep disturbance, wandering, loss of inhibitions or delusions\n- Certain skills like reading, music appreciation, storytelling, singing, dancing or crafts may persist longer because they rely on brain regions affected later\n\n**Causes**\n- Abnormal protein buildup (amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles) leads to neuron death and brain shrinkage over time, producing the cognitive symptoms described\n- Advanced disease increases vulnerability to dehydration, malnutrition and infections, which can be fatal\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Consult a healthcare professional if you notice memory or thinking changes in yourself or someone else, since other treatable conditions can mimic dementia and early evaluation allows symptom management and support planning\n",
