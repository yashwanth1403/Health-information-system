  "body": "Sleep apnoea causes breathing to stop and start during sleep—most commonly obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)—and requires treatment to avoid serious complications.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- During sleep: breathing pauses, gasping/snorting/choking noises, frequent waking and loud snoring (often best observed by another person)\n- Daytime: severe tiredness, poor concentration, mood swings and morning headaches\n\n**Causes**\n- Airways that narrow during sleep, linked to obesity, large neck, older age (though it can affect children and young adults), family history, smoking, alcohol, large tonsils/adenoids, sleeping on the back and COPD\n\n**Prevention**\n- Ask a GP about sleep-clinic testing; overnight devices measure breathing and heart rate to calculate an apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI): 5–14 mild, 15–30 moderate, over 30 severe\n- Treatments include lifestyle changes (weight loss, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) every night to keep airways open, mandibular advancement devices and surgery (such as removing large tonsils)\n- Self-help tips: lose weight if needed, exercise regularly, maintain good sleep habits (dark, quiet bedroom, consistent schedule), sleep on your side using a tennis ball or special pillow, avoid smoking, limit alcohol—especially before bed—and only take sleeping pills if prescribed\n- You may need to notify the DVLA and must not drive until daytime symptoms such as tiredness are controlled\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Consult a GP if breathing pauses during sleep, you make gasping/snorting/choking noises at night, or you feel very tired during the day; bring someone who has witnessed your sleep if possible\n- Untreated sleep apnoea increases risks of high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, depression, accidents from tiredness and strained relationships, so prompt medical assessment and treatment are important\n",
