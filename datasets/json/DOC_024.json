  "body": "Back pain—especially in the lower back—is very common, usually improves over a few weeks, but can return or signal more serious problems in rarer cases; self-care plus medical support can help ease symptoms.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Pain intensity ranges from mild (comes and goes but allows daily activities) to moderate (constant, affects sleep and concentration) and severe (constant, overwhelming, limits movement, self-care and sleep)\n- Pain may worsen with sneezing, coughing or bowel movements, or be located anywhere from the lower back to between the shoulders\n\n**Causes**\n- Often unclear but may stem from injuries such as pulled muscles or strains\n- Conditions including slipped discs, sciatica (trapped nerve) or ankylosing spondylitis can trigger back pain\n- Rarely, serious issues like broken bones, cancer or infection are responsible\n\n**Prevention**\n- Stay active and keep up daily activities; avoid prolonged bed rest\n- Use ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatory medicine (paracetamol alone is not recommended but can be combined with another painkiller if advised)\n- Apply ice packs (wrapped) to reduce pain/swelling and heat packs to relieve stiffness or muscle spasm\n- Practise back-specific exercises and stretches, stopping if pain worsens, and consider activities such as walking, swimming, yoga or pilates\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- See a GP if home measures fail after a few weeks, pain limits daily tasks, grows more severe, or causes worry and coping difficulties; they may prescribe painkillers, muscle relaxants or refer for physiotherapy, manual therapy, CBT, nerve procedures or surgery when indicated\n- Seek urgent GP/111 advice for back pain with high temperature, unexplained weight loss, lumps or shape changes, pain worse at night or after rest, pain triggered by sneezing/coughing/pooing, or pain higher up the back\n- Call 999 or go to A&E (do not drive yourself) for back pain with pain/tingling/weakness/numbness in both legs, numbness around genitals or buttocks, difficulty peeing, loss of bladder/bowel control, chest pain, or pain after a serious accident; bring current medicines with you\n",
