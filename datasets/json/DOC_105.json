  "body": "Sexual health is fundamental to individual, familial, community and societal well-being and development. An affirmative view of sexual health requires positive, respectful approaches to sexuality and relationships, and the possibility of pleasurable, safe sexual experiences free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Achieving sexual health and well-being depends on access to comprehensive, high-quality information about sex and sexuality; awareness of risks and personal vulnerability; access to sexual health care; and supportive environments that promote sexual health. Sexual health is a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, and the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. Sexual health concerns span sexual orientation, gender identity, expression, relationships and pleasure, as well as adverse outcomes such as HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reproductive tract infections (RTIs), unintended pregnancy, sexual dysfunction, sexual violence, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation (FGM). Sexual health concerns well-being, not just absence of disease; requires respect, safety, and freedom from discrimination and violence; depends on fulfilment of human rights; applies throughout the lifespan, for youth and older adults as well as people of reproductive age; is expressed through diverse sexualities and forms of expression; is shaped by gender norms, roles, expectations, and power dynamics; and must be understood within specific social, economic and political contexts.",
