  "body": "Simple lifestyle changes can prevent, ease or eliminate digestive problems:\n\n1. **Beat stress:** Anxiety disrupts digestion—slowing it (bloating, pain, constipation) or speeding it up (diarrhoea). It can also worsen ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome. Managing and reducing stress helps maintain digestive balance.\n\n2. **Stop smoking:** Smoking weakens the muscle at the lower end of the oesophagus, allowing stomach acid to flow back (reflux). This causes heartburn and can aggravate ulcers and inflammatory bowel conditions, and increases stomach cancer risk.\n\n3. **Eat properly:** Adopt healthy eating habits: eat slowly and chew well; avoid overeating by reducing portion sizes or having 4–5 smaller meals; eat regularly without skipping meals; avoid large meals within 2–3 hours of bedtime; stay hydrated with plenty of water.\n\n4. **Lose excess weight:** Abdominal fat places pressure on the stomach, triggering heartburn and acid-related symptoms. Weight loss can relieve these complaints. Use BMI calculators to check weight status and follow NHS weight-loss advice if needed.\n\n5. **Avoid binge drinking:** Moderate alcohol intake may not harm digestion, but binge drinking (drinking too much in a single session) increases stomach acid production and can cause heartburn or aggravate other digestive disorders. Cutting down on alcohol helps protect digestive health.\n\nIncorporating these habits supports a healthier digestive system and reduces the likelihood of stomach upsets.",
