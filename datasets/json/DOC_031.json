  "body": "Antibiotics treat or prevent certain bacterial infections by killing bacteria or stopping them spreading, but they do not work for viral illnesses (colds, flu, most coughs), and unnecessary use drives antibiotic resistance, so always follow medical advice.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Common side effects when antibiotics are taken correctly include feeling or being sick, bloating, indigestion and diarrhoea\n- Allergic reactions (more likely with penicillins or cephalosporins) can cause itchy, red, swollen, blistered or peeling rashes, wheeze, tight chest or throat, trouble breathing or talking, or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat; these signs of anaphylaxis require emergency care\n- Taking doses too close together raises the risk of stomach pain, diarrhoea and nausea\n\n**Causes**\n- Antibiotics are prescribed for bacterial infections unlikely to clear without help, those that could take too long, carry serious complication risks or might easily spread to others; infectiousness may continue for 48 hours to 14 days after treatment starts, so seek GP/pharmacist advice\n- High-risk people may receive prophylactic antibiotics before exposure to anticipated infections\n- Formulations include tablets, capsules and liquids for mild to moderate infections; creams, lotions, sprays and drops for skin, eye or ear infections; and injections or intravenous drips for more serious illnesses\n- Major antibiotic groups include:\n  - Penicillins (penicillin, amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, flucloxacillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin) for skin, chest and urinary infections\n  - Cephalosporins (cefalexin) for many infections, including sepsis or meningitis\n  - Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramycin) mainly in hospital for severe infections, sometimes as eye/ear drops\n  - Tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, lymecycline) for varied infections, acne or rosacea\n  - Macrolides (azithromycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin) for lung/chest infections or penicillin-resistant cases\n  - Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) once widely used for respiratory or urinary infections but now limited due to serious side effects\n  - Other options include chloramphenicol (eye/ear), fusidic acid (skin/eye), and nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim (urinary tract infections)\n\n**Prevention**\n- Take antibiotics exactly as directed on the label, leaflet or by your GP/pharmacist; never share medicines prescribed for someone else\n- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as possible unless it is nearly time for the next one—never double up; if multiple doses are missed or extra doses taken, contact a GP or NHS 111, especially if severe side effects occur\n- Always inform healthcare professionals if you are pregnant or breastfeeding so suitable options can be chosen, and review possible interactions with medicines (e.g., contraceptive pill) or alcohol by reading the information leaflet or consulting a pharmacist/GP\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Seek urgent medical help (call 999 or go to A&E) for symptoms of anaphylaxis such as severe rash, wheeze, tight chest, breathing or speech difficulty, or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue or throat\n- Contact a GP or NHS 111 if you take more than one extra dose, experience troublesome side effects, or need advice about infectiousness, prophylaxis or suitability with other health conditions or treatments\n",
