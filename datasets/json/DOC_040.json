  "body": "Family planning empowers people to decide how many children to have and when, through contraception and infertility care that uphold sexual and reproductive rights, advance health and gender equality, and support SDG 3.7’s goal of universal reproductive healthcare.\n\n**Causes**\n- Global need remains high: of 1.9 billion women aged 15–49 in 2021, 1.1 billion required family planning, 874 million used modern contraception and 164 million had unmet need\n- Barriers include limited method availability (especially in low-resource or rural settings), restrictions linked to age, income or marital status, fear of side effects, misinformation, social or religious opposition, poor service quality, provider bias and gender inequality requiring partner consent or causing stigma\n\n**Prevention**\n- Modern contraceptive options span long-acting methods (implants, IUDs, sterilization), regular-use methods (pills, injections, patches, vaginal rings), barrier methods (condoms—the only method protecting against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections including HIV) and less reliable methods (fertility awareness, withdrawal); choice should reflect personal health, preferences and needs with guidance from health workers\n- Family planning reduces unintended pregnancies, lowers health risks for adolescents, supports education/employment, strengthens health systems and fuels economic growth, with modern contraceptive use projected to rise by 70 million women by 2030\n- Infertility, affecting about 1 in 6 adults due to infections, medical conditions, environmental or lifestyle factors in any gender, must be addressed within family planning; modern contraceptives do not cause infertility, yet women often face disproportionate social blame, stigma and distress, making access to infertility care essential\n- WHO supports universal access by issuing evidence-based safety/delivery guidelines, promoting human-rights-centred programmes, helping countries adapt tools, advancing new contraceptive technologies and researching better service access\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- Consult healthcare professionals to choose suitable contraception, receive accurate information on benefits and side effects, and obtain infertility evaluation or treatment; professional guidance ensures methods match individual health profiles and helps overcome misinformation or barriers\n",
