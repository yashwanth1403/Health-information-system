  "body": "Allergic rhinitis occurs when allergens such as pollen irritate the nose, provoking sneezing and other symptoms that most people can control with pharmacy treatments.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Sneezing, itchy nose, runny or blocked nose\n- Itchy, red, watery eyes\n- Cough\n- Itchy roof of the mouth\n- Symptoms typically appear within minutes of allergen exposure\n\n**Causes**\n- Allergic reactions to pollen (hay fever), house dust mites, pet dander, mould or workplace triggers (wood dust, flour dust, latex)\n- Family history of allergies, eczema or asthma raises risk\n- Differs from non-allergic rhinitis, which may stem from infections, temperature changes or humidity\n\n**Prevention**\n- Avoid triggers when possible; pharmacists can recommend antihistamines, short-term decongestant sprays/drops (not for children under 6 and not beyond a week), and saline sprays or homemade saltwater rinses\n- If you have a high temperature or feel unwell, stay home and limit contact until better\n- Practical tips: wear wraparound sunglasses during pollen season; use hypoallergenic bedding and wash at 60°C+; dust with a damp cloth; vacuum with a HEPA filter; wash pets every two weeks and groom them outdoors; clean pet bedding and furniture; keep the home dry, well ventilated, and address damp or condensation; avoid letting pets into bedrooms and try not to go outside or dry clothes outdoors when pollen counts are high\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- See a GP if symptoms worsen, asthma also deteriorates, sleep or daily life is affected, triggers are unclear, or pharmacy remedies do not help\n- A GP may prescribe steroid nasal sprays, alternative antihistamines or refer you to a specialist for further tests and treatment\n",
