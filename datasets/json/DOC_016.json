  "title": "Underactive Thyroid (Hypothyroidism)",
  "body": "An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) happens when the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormone, leading to issues such as tiredness and weight gain that can usually be managed with lifelong treatment.\n\n**Symptoms**\n- Extreme tiredness, feeling cold more than usual or weight gain\n- Constipation, difficulty concentrating, low mood or depression\n- Dry skin, dry hair or hair loss, a hoarse voice, irregular or heavy periods\n- Symptoms often develop slowly, may be mild at first and can resemble other conditions\n\n**Causes**\n- Hashimoto's disease, where the immune system attacks the thyroid (most common in women aged 30–50)\n- Other thyroid problems such as thyroiditis, previous thyroid surgery or radiotherapy, or treatment for an overactive thyroid\n- Low iodine intake (rare in the UK), certain medicines and family history of thyroid disease\n\n**When to See a Doctor**\n- See a GP if you experience possible hypothyroidism symptoms so they can examine you and order blood tests (TSH and T4)\n- Inform your GP if you are pregnant or planning pregnancy, because levothyroxine doses and monitoring usually need adjustment to reduce risks such as pre-eclampsia, birth defects, premature birth or miscarriage\n",
